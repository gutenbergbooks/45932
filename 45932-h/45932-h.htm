<span class="smcap small">Types Of Motors</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> are certain events that must happen
in a gasoline motor before the engine
will run of its own accord. For instance,
to obtain successive power impulses, the
charge must first be admitted to the cylinder
and compressed; it must then be ignited to
form the explosion that creates the force at the
flywheel; and the burned gases resulting from
this explosion must be ejected in order to clear
the cylinder for the new charge. To accomplish
this series of events, some motors require
four strokes, while others do the
business in two. These are popularly called
four-cycle and two-cycle motors, respectively.</p>

<p>A cycle, of course, can be any round of
events, such as a cycle of years&mdash;at the end of
which time the previous happenings are
scheduled to repeat themselves. But in gas engine
parlance a cycle is taken to mean the
round of events from, say, the explosion of one
charge to the ignition of the next. Thus, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
will be seen that the four-cycle motor requires
four strokes of the piston to accomplish its
round of events, and is, properly, a four-<em>stroke</em>
cycle motor. Likewise, the so-called two-cycle
motor requires two strokes to complete its cycle
and should therefore be termed a two-<em>stroke</em>
cycle motor.</p>

<p>If this longer terminology could be adhered
to, there would be less misunderstanding of the
meanings of two- and four-cycle, for when
taken literally, these abbreviated forms signify
absolutely nothing. Usage seems to have
made them acceptable, however, and if the
reader will but remember that four-cycle, for
instance, means four <em>strokes per cycle</em>, the term
becomes almost as simple as does "four-cylinder."</p>

<p>It is evident that there are two strokes for
each revolution of the flywheel&mdash;one when the
crank is forced down and the other when the
crank moves up. As the piston is attached to
the crank through the medium of the connecting
rod, the strokes are measured by the
motion of the piston. Thus, since it requires
four strokes of the piston to complete the
round of events in the four-cycle motor, the explosions
occur only at every second revolution
of the flywheel. In this connection it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
remembered that we are dealing with but one
cylinder at a time, for a four-cycle engine is
practically a collection of four single-cylinder
units.</p>

<p>But even though the explosion in a four-cycle
motor occurs only every other revolution, the
engine is by no means idle during the interval
between these power impulses, for each stroke
has its own work to do. The explosion exerts
a force similar to a "hammer blow" of several
tons on the piston, and the latter is pushed
down, thus forming the first stroke of the cycle.
The momentum of the flywheel carries the piston
back again to the top of its travel, and
during this second stroke all of the burned, or
exhaust, gases are forced out and the cylinder
is cleaned, or "scavenged." The piston is
then carried down on its third stroke, which
tends to create a partial vacuum and sucks in
the charge for the next explosion.</p>

<p>On the fourth, and final, stroke of the cycle
the piston, still actuated by the momentum of
the flywheel, is pushed up against the recently-admitted
charge and compresses this to a point
five or six times greater than that of the atmosphere.
At the extreme top of this last stroke,
the spark is formed, causing the next explosion,
and the events of this cycle are repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>Now, inasmuch as on one up-stroke of the
piston the charge must be held tightly in place
in order that it may be compressed, and on the
next up-stroke a free passage must be offered
so that the exhaust gases may be forced out, it
is evident that a valve must be used as a sentry
placed at the openings to restrain the desirable
gas from escaping and also to facilitate the retreat
of the objectionable exhaust. Likewise,
the force of the explosion must be confined to
the piston on one down-stroke in order that all
of the energy may be concentrated at the crank,
while on the succeeding down-stroke a free passage
must be afforded to the charge so that it
may be sucked in through the carburetor. Consequently
a second valve must be used to control
the inlet passage on the down-strokes and
prevent the escape of the force of the explosion
through an opening that was intended as an entrance
for the fresh charge. Thus valves are
a necessity on all motors in which successive
similar strokes of the piston do not perform
the same operations.</p>

<p>As quadrupeds and bipeds form the two
great divisions of the animal kingdom, so is
the motor separated into the two main classes
of four-cycle and two-cycle engines. Even
though to all exterior appearances, the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
types of motors may be identical, the distinction,
to the engineer, at least, is as marked as is
the difference between a stork and an elephant.
The difference is somewhat reversed, however,
in that, while the elephant has double the number
of legs of the stork, the four-cycle motor
has but one-half the number of power impulses
of its two-cycle cousin at the same speed.</p>

<p>In other words, there is an explosion in each
cylinder of the two-cycle motor with every
revolution of the flywheel,&mdash;instead of with
alternate revolutions, as is the case with the
four-cycle type. But the number of events
necessary to produce each explosion must be
the same in both types of motors, and consequently
it is only by "doubling up" and performing
several operations with each stroke
that the two-cycle motor can obtain a power
impulse with each revolution of the flywheel.</p>

<p>Starting with the ignition of the charge, as
in the four-cycle motor, let us see how the
events are combined in the two-cycle type so
that all will occur within the allotted two
strokes. Directly after the explosion there is
but one event that can happen if this force has
been properly harnessed, and that is the violent
downward travel of the piston. Just before
the bottom of this downward stroke is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
reached, however, an opening is uncovered
through which the exhaust gases can expend
the remainder of their energy&mdash;which by this
time has become greatly reduced. Immediately
after this another passage is uncovered and the
charge is forced into the cylinder under pressure,
thus helping to clear the cylinder of the
remainder of the exhaust gases.</p>

<p>All of this takes place near the end of the
down-stroke; and at the beginning of its return,
the piston closes the openings previously uncovered
for the passage of the exhaust gases
and incoming charge, and then compresses the
mixture during the remainder of its up-stroke.
Thus the suction stroke and the "scavenging"
stroke of the four-cycle motor are dispensed
with in the two-cycle type and every downward
thrust of the piston is a power stroke.</p>

<p>The two-cycle motor has been used in several
notable instances with great success on
motor cars, but by far the larger majority of
automobile power plants are of the four-cycle
type. In view of the wonderful simplicity of
the two-cycle motor, its small number of moving
parts, and its more frequent power impulses,
it may well be asked: "Why is this not
in more popular use on the motor car?" The
four-cycle motor has but one power stroke out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of every four, while only alternate strokes of
the two-cycle motor consume power without
producing any.</p>

<p>This would seem to indicate that, for equal
sizes and weights, the two-cycle motor would
produce twice as much power as the four-cycle
type&mdash;and this is true theoretically. But the
four-cycle motor devotes an entire stroke to
forcing out the exhaust gases, or scavenging,
and another entire stroke to drawing in a fresh
charge, and it is evident that these operations
can be done much more effectively in this manner
than when combined with several other
events following each other in such rapid succession
as is the case with the two-cycle motor.
In the two-cycle motor the incoming charge
must be diluted to a certain extent with the exhaust
gases which have not been entirely expelled,
and the intake valve port is uncovered
for so short a time that unless there has been
very high compression in the base, the cylinder
cannot be entirely filled with the explosive mixture
at high speeds. This is described in
greater detail in the <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">last chapter</a> of this volume.
Thus, while admittedly simpler in construction
and operation than the four-cycle, the two-cycle
motor in its ordinary forms does not obtain
quite as high an efficiency from the fuel as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
does its more complicated cousin. Each type
has its distinct use, however, and in many instances
in which low initial cost and simplicity
of design are more desirable than are economy
of fuel and high efficiency of operation,
the two-cycle motor stands supreme.</p>

<p>The sentries that stand guard over the passages
through which the gases make their entrance
and exit may appear in a variety of
guises, but they determine the shape of the
cylinders of a motor and divide the four-cycle
engine into a number of classes. For instance,
if the valves controlling the admission of the
explosive mixture are placed on one side of the
cylinders and those officiating over the exit of
the exhaust gases are located on the opposite
side, the motor is known as the "T-head" type
because of the shape of its cylinders.</p>

<p>All valves that are placed at the side of the
cylinder must operate in pockets so as not to interfere
with the movement of the piston.
These pockets are cast with the cylinder and
form a projection at its side near the top.
When these projections are cast on opposite
sides, a cylinder having the shape of the letter
"T" is formed, while if the valves operate
on the same side, the single projection forms
a cylinder having the shape of the inverted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
letter "L." Hence cylinders having valves on
opposite sides are called "T"-head motors,
while "L"-head motor is synonymous for an
engine having "valves on the same side."</p>

<p>When the valves are placed in the head,
there is no need of separate pockets, for these
valves operate from above and do not interfere
with the movement of the piston. There
may be a combination of these positions, one
set of valves being placed in the head and the
others at the side. This is known as the "inlet
in head, exhaust at side" type&mdash;or vice
versa, as the case may be.</p>

<p>The valve that has been in almost universal
use in motor cars is known as the "poppet"
type, as distinguished from the sliding and
rotary styles. As evidenced by its name, the
poppet valve is pushed or lifted from its seat,
and thus the full area of the opening to the passage
is made available almost immediately.
The poppet valve is lifted by a cam, the shape
of which determines the relative speed of
operation of the valve, and is returned to its
seat by a stiff spring. The nature of the contact
that the valve makes with its seat depends
upon the condition of the surfaces and is the
deciding factor as to whether the joint is completely
air-tight or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>When the exhaust valve is opened, its head
is thrust directly in the path of the hot, out-rushing
gases; these same gases also swirl
around the edge of the seat. The excessive
heat and the particles of carbon that are often
found in the exhaust gases tend to corrode and
build a deposit on the edges of the valve and
its seat, thus eventually preventing perfect contact
from taking place. This makes necessary
the grinding of the valves&mdash;an operation that
is familiar to the majority of motor car owners
and drivers.</p>

<p>While the poppet valve motor is still used
on the majority of automobiles, a new and
radical type of valve mechanism has been giving
successful results. This is known as the
sliding sleeve type of motor, and while it has
been used for several seasons in Europe, 1912
saw its adoption for the first time in America.
The sleeve motor, it must be understood, is of
the four-cycle type, the events occurring in the
same order as on any ordinary automobile motor,
and the only difference lies in the nature
of the valves that control the openings of the
exhaust and inlet passages. That this difference
is great, however, will be realized when
it is understood that the valves consist of two
concentric shells, in the inner one of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
piston reciprocates. In other words, two hollow
cylinders line the interior of the cylinder
casting and replace the poppet valves and
pockets of the more familiar type of motor.</p>

<p>These sleeves, or shells, or hollow cylinders&mdash;or
whatever name it is chosen to give them&mdash;slide
up and down in the same line of action
as that of the piston. A port, or slot, is cut
near the top on opposite sides of each of the
shells. These four ports are so arranged that
one set opens directly opposite the intake passage,
while the other opens by the exhaust
manifold entrance. When it is said that these
ports open, it is meant that similar slots in the
two sleeves come opposite each other, or
"register," so that an unobstructed passage for
the gas is offered. The port in one sleeve may
be opposite the intake pipe entrance, but if
the slot in the other sleeve does not correspond
with this, the passage is effectively closed.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the ports are opened
and closed by the movement of the sleeves in
opposite directions. For example, just before
the opening of the intake port, the inner sleeves
will be traveling upward while the outer shell
moves downward, and the slots in the two
shells will be opposite each other at the instant
that they pass the inlet pipe. This gives a much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
quicker opening than would be the case if one
shell stood still while the other moved downward,
and it is because the slots approach each
other from opposite directions that this motor
can be run efficiently at high speeds.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as this is a four-cycle motor and
the explosions occur in each cylinder but once
during every two revolutions of the flywheel,
each sleeve makes but one stroke for every two
of the piston. The sleeves are operated by
eccentrics attached to a shaft driven at a two-to-one
speed by the crank shaft of the motor,
and as they are well lubricated there is but very
little friction generated between them and the
piston. In fact, it has been shown that the
power required to operate the sleeves, when
well lubricated, is considerably less than that
consumed by the springs and valve mechanism
of the poppet valve motor, for the reason that
the former type of valve does not open against
the pressure of the exhaust, as is the case with
the ordinary gas engine valve.</p>

<p>Besides the two- and four-cycle divisions, a
motor is known by the arrangement of its
cylinders and is classified as "cylinders cast
separately," "cast in pairs," or "triple cast,"
according to whether there are one, two or
three cylinders to a unit. The last-named type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
is not as common as are the "pair-cast" cylinders
and of course can only be used on six-cylinder
motors.</p>

<p>When all of the cylinders of a motor are
cast in one piece, the engine is known as a
"bloc" motor. This is a type that has come
into popular use for small and medium-sized
power plants during the past few years on account
of the simplicity of its construction and
the smooth and compact design that is rendered
possible. Of course it may be argued that, with
such a design, the entire set must be replaced
if a single cylinder is damaged, but castings
have been so improved that an accident or imperfection
requiring the renewal of a cylinder
is very rare.</p>

<p>It is evident that, beyond a certain size of
cylinder, a bloc casting becomes too bulky to be
handled conveniently, and as the entire casting
must be removed when it is desired to reach
the connecting rods, crank shaft, or piston
rings, a motor so designed will seldom be found
that develops more than forty or fifty horsepower.
This type of casting is found on some
six-cylinder cars, however, but it is naturally
only the "light sixes" that will use such a motor.</p>

<p>Above six-cylinders, a motor is usually arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
with its power units set at an angle on
either side of the vertical, thus forming the
V-shaped motor. Several eight-cylinder motors
are so constructed, the units being arranged
four on a side and each set placed at an angle
of about thirty degrees from the vertical. This
gives the effect of two four-cylinder motors
placed side by side and operating on the same
crank shaft.</p>

<p>In order to make the motor as compact as
possible, the cylinders are "staggered;" or, in
other words, the cylinders of one set are placed
opposite the spaces between the units of the
other. It will be seen that the V-shaped design
of motor shortens the power plant and enables
it to be set in a much smaller space under the
bonnet than would be the case were the cylinders
placed one in front of the other, as in the
four- and six-cylinder types.</p>

<p>As a rule, the two-cylinder, four-cycle motor
is of a different type from its four- and six-cylinder
cousins, and is known as a "horizontal
opposed" engine. In such a motor, the
cylinders are set lengthwise and the pistons
operate opposite each other in such a manner
that a "long, narrow, and thin" power plant
is obtained that is especially well-suited for a
location under the body of the car. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
this horizontal motor, which may, of course, be
of the four-cylinder type, is the only shape that
can well be used under the body or seat of a
touring car. In some small runabouts, however,
the "double-opposed" motor is used to
good advantage under the forward bonnet, as
in the "big fellows."</p>

<p>There are, of course, many other features of
design that serve to differentiate one automobile
power plant from another, but these are
details that do not serve to classify the motor,
and the man who knows whether his machine
is two- or four-cycle; poppet or sleeve valve;
separate, pair, or en bloc cylinder castings;
and "T"- or "L"-head shape will have at his
fingers' ends distinctions that would have
"floored" the salesman of a few years ago.</p>

<span class="smcap small">Valves</span></h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">It</span> has been stated in the <a href="#CHAPTER_I">preceding chapter</a>
that the valves of the gasoline motor are
the sentinels placed on guard at the entrance
to and exit from each cylinder to make
certain that the mixture follows its proper
course at the proper time.</p>

<p>Therefore, if we accept the definition that a
valve is a mechanical appliance for controlling
the flow of a liquid or a gas, strictly speaking
no such thing as a "valveless" motor exists.
Two-cycle motors are sometimes said to be
valveless because of the fact that the movement
of the piston automatically regulates the
flow of the exhaust and intake gases, but in this
case the piston is in reality the valve. On the
four-cycle motor, however, like events take
place only on alternate strokes in the same direction,
and consequently some controlling
mechanism that operates but once for every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
four strokes of the piston is needed to time the
flow of the gases.</p>

<p>As has been stated in the <a href="#CHAPTER_I">previous chapter</a>,
the most common form of valve is known as
the poppet type from the fact that its action
is a lifting one. Such a valve may be located
in a projection cast on either side of the top
of each cylinder, or it may be inverted from
this position and placed in the cylinder head.
When in the former location, the valve is
opened by an upward push on the rod to which
it is attached at its center, while a valve placed
in the cylinder head is forced down to allow
the escape or entrance of the exhaust or intake
gases. The ordinary type of poppet valve is
somewhat similar in shape to a mushroom,
having a very thin and flat head and a slender
stem. The disc portion of the valve is known
as its head, while the rod forged with the valve
and by which the head is raised and lowered
is called the stem.</p>

<p>The projections cast in the cylinders of a
"T"-head or "L"-head motor, and in which
the valves are placed, are known as the valve
pockets. Valves so located are lifted by a direct
upward push caused by the rotation of a
cam and are returned to their closed position
by means of the extension of a stiff spiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
spring surrounding each valve stem. It is only
the outer edge of the lower side of the valve
head that comes in contact with the surrounding
surfaces of the opening which is closed
when the valve is returned to its ordinary position
by the spring.</p>

<p>This surface of contact surrounding the
opening is known as the valve seat, and it is
this, together with the edge of the valve which
rests against it, that must be ground smooth
in order to insure a tight joint when the valve
is closed. On the majority of poppet valves
the edge of the head and the seat against which
it rests are beveled to an angle of approximately
forty degrees in order to conform to
the natural direction taken by the gases when
they are admitted or expelled. In a few cases,
however, the seat angle is ninety degrees, which
means that the edge of the head is ground flat,
or straight, at right angles to the stem.</p>

<p>One of the chief advantages found in the
use of a poppet valve is the fact that a large
opening can be obtained after the valve head
has been raised but a comparatively short distance.
This means that the valve stem need
travel only a fraction of an inch between the
full open and the full closed position of the
valve and that the operating mechanism for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
obtaining this lift is simple. Practically every
poppet valve, therefore, is lifted by means of
a cam, which is a thick, irregularly-shaped
piece of steel mounted on a shaft known as
the cam shaft. If the end of the valve stem,
or a rod connected to it, is held against the
periphery of the cam while the latter is revolved
by its shaft, the valve will be forced up,
or away, rather, an amount corresponding to
the increase in distance between the periphery
of the cam at this point of contact and its
axis.</p>

<p>In other words, if the cam were a true circle
with its axis passing through its center, there
would be no motion of the valve, for all points
of the periphery of a circle are at the same distance
from the center. Consequently a portion
of the periphery of the cam is extended in the
shape of a "nose," the projection of this beyond
the smallest diameter of the cam being
the distance that the valve will be lifted when
this point of the cam surface comes in contact
with the stem or push rod. The broader,
or more blunt, the nose of the cam,
the longer will the valve remain open
as the cam shaft is revolved, while the
"slope" of the sides of the nose determines
the rapidity with which the valve will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
pushed out and back. Inasmuch as the valve
should remain closed throughout two-thirds or
three-quarters of every two revolutions of the
flywheel, the greater part of the periphery of
the cam is circular, or at the same distance
from the axis at all points.</p>

<p>As has been mentioned before, the cam
serves only to lift the valve, the return of the
latter to its seat being obtained by the force
from a spring that is coiled around the stem.
Thus the spring holds the end of the push rod
at all times against the periphery of the cam.
This push rod, in some instances, is a small
bar of special steel that slides in guides of long-wearing
bearing alloy. The upper end of the
push rod is in contact with the lower end of
the valve stem, while its other extremity is oftentimes
designed in the form of a small steel
roller that thus serves to create a rolling contact
with the periphery of the cam.</p>

<p>In other designs, the lower extremity of the
push rod may be in the form of a specially-hardened
steel pin with a rounded end, while
still a third type consists of a flat disc slightly
"offset" on the end of the push rod so that
various points of its surface will come in contact
with the periphery of the cam and the
wear will be evenly distributed. Whatever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
particular design, however, the cam is well
lubricated and both it and the push rod are
intended to last as long as any part of the motor.</p>

<p>Many motors are designed with one valve at
the side and the other, usually the intake, in
the head. There are also many motors manufactured
that have both the intake and the exhaust
valves located in the head, in which case
the valve pockets, or projections, are eliminated.
Such valves may be operated by the
same type of cams and cam shaft as those used
to open the valves at the side. As the opening
of a valve located in the head is downward,
however, the motion produced by the cam on
the push rod must be reversed in direction.
This reversal of motion is obtained by means
of a lever mounted at its center and placed in
contact with the upper extremity of the push
rod at its outer end. The other end of this
lever operates in contact with the end of the
valve stem, and thus an upward push on the
rod is converted into a downward thrust on the
stem. This lever that reverses the direction of
the push rod motion is known as a rocker arm
and is mounted in a yoke cast with the cylinder
head.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as a spring is used to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
valve tightly closed when the cam is not lifting
the latter, it is the contact of the valve head
with its seat that must form the stop to the
motion of the spring. It will be seen that the
force of the spring is communicated through
the valve stem to the push rod, and thence to
the periphery of the cam when the latter is in
a position to lift the valve. The push rod
should not be forced tightly against the periphery
of the cam when the valve is closed, however,
for this would prevent perfect contact
between the valve and its seat. Consequently
there should be a certain amount of "play"
between the end of the push rod and valve stem
so that it will be certain that the head is forced
against the seat with the full power of the
spring and without the cam serving as a stop.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this play should not be
too great, for the cam and push rod will then
move an appreciable distance before the valve
is raised. This will cause the opening of the
valve to occur late and will reduce the distance
that the stem is raised, thus restricting the size
of the opening. Furthermore, an undue
amount of play between the ends of the push
rod and stem will result in a pound or "hammer
blow" between the two that is liable to
wear the surfaces rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>The "happy medium" that will give the
best results may be obtained by properly setting
the small valve "tappets" that are secured
to the end of the stems or push rods.
By turning the nut of the tappet in one direction,
the length of the push rod will be reduced,
while the reverse operation will increase
the length of the rod or stem. This is
primarily intended for taking up any wear that
may occur at the ends of the push rod or valve
stem. In the case of engines having the valves
in the head, the long push rod of each valve
should be so loose as to move perceptibly when
shoved up and down by the thumb and finger.</p>

<p>When the rocker arm is pressed down
against the valve stem, the space between the
other end of the rocker arm and the push rod
should be sufficiently wide to admit a piece of
tissue paper. The same test may be made in
connection with valves located at the side, after
first ascertaining that the end of the short
push rod is resting firmly against the periphery
of the cam. The play will be apparent,
of course, only when the valve is tightly closed,
and in order to make certain that their cams
are in the "inactive" position, the piston
should be set at the beginning of the explosion
stroke when testing the intake or exhaust valve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
This is at the point of ignition and is the time
at which both valves should be tightly closed.</p>

<p>The cam shaft to which the cams that operate
the valves are attached is generally placed
inside the crank case. If the motor is of the
"T"-head type, having valves on opposite
sides of the cylinders, the cam shaft operating
the exhaust valves will be found on one side of
the crank case, while that for opening the inlet
valves will be located on the other. If the
motor is of the "L"-head type, all the cams
will be placed on the one shaft. The cams are
sometimes forged with their shaft in a solid
piece, while in other designs they are keyed in
place, but whatever type is used, the cams and
their shaft may be considered as integral with
each other.</p>

<p>The cam shafts are generally driven by a
gear meshing with a smaller one attached to
the front end of the crank shaft of the motor,
which forms one of the forward train of gears
that are enclosed in an aluminum case. If the
cam shaft is driven at the same speed as is the
crank shaft of the motor, it will be seen that
the valves will open once at every revolution
of the flywheel. In a four-cycle motor, however,
the explosion and other events occur but
once in each cylinder for every two revolutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of the flywheel, and consequently the cam shaft
must be driven at one-half the speed of the
crank shaft.</p>

<p>To obtain the proper speed ratio, each cam
shaft is driven by a "two-to-one" gear, which
means that the gear on the end of the crank
shaft has but one-half as many teeth as have
those attached to the cam shafts. There is
thus one revolution of each cam shaft gear
for every two of the crank shaft gear, and consequently
each cam shaft is driven at the required
half speed.</p>

<p>The cam shafts may be driven by a chain,
the links of which fit over teeth cut on sprocket
wheels, but there must always be a constant
relation between the position of the cam shaft
and that of the crank shaft. This constant
relation is necessary in order that the valves
will open and close at the proper points during
the travel of the piston. For example, the
exhaust valve should open toward the end of
the explosion stroke in order to allow the
burned gases to be forced out, and the cam for
operating this valve should always be in the
lifting position at exactly the proper moment.</p>

<p>If the cam shaft is not positively driven, this
position may change and the exhaust valve
might be opened at the beginning of the ignition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of the charge, in which case the force of
the explosion would be wasted almost entirely.
On the other hand, the inlet valve should open
at about the beginning of the suction stroke in
order that the fresh charge may be drawn in by
the downward travel of the piston; it is evident
that this cannot be opened at any other
time without a resulting loss in the power developed
by the motor.</p>

<p>The proper timing of the action of the
valves is consequently one of the most important
adjustments of a motor. When the motor
is assembled and tested at the factory, the
valves are properly timed and there is no possibility
that they will require further adjustment
in this respect until after the engine is "taken
down" for the purpose of cleaning or the renewal
of a broken part. If it should ever become
necessary to remove one of the cam
shafts or any of the gears constituting the forward
train, the greatest care should be taken to
make certain that all are returned to <em>exactly</em>
their original position. A difference of one
tooth in the relative meshing of the gears may
result in a loss of fifty per cent. of the power
developed by the motor.</p>

<p>Absolute rules for the proper timing of the
valves cannot be given here, for various motors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
are designed with slightly different positions
at which the exhaust and inlet valves
should be opened and closed. A cam shaft
should never be removed, however, without
first marking the intermeshing teeth of its driving
gear and those of its companions. This
may best be done by means of a small prick
punch which, when tapped lightly with a hammer,
will make a permanent mark at the desired
point on the surface of the gear. If the
motor is of the "T"-head type, having its
valves operated by two cam shafts, care should
be taken to designate the right and left-hand
gears so that their positions will not be reversed
if both have been removed at the same
time.</p>

<p>A safe method to pursue is to indicate the
right-hand gear with one punch mark, while
two should be used for the gear at the left.
Three teeth should be marked on each pair
of intermeshing gears. That is, a tooth on one
gear should be marked, and then each of the
teeth between which it meshes on the other
gear. The second cam shaft gear should be
marked before the motor is turned.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the cams on many motors
are forged integral with their shafts, and
there is consequently no possibility of the removal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
of one from the other. Those cams
which are keyed to their shafts are accurately
and rigidly set and the keyways so cut that
there is slight chance of a mistake in returning
a cam that has been removed. It should
seldom be necessary to remove a cam from its
shaft, however.</p>

<p>Many motors are provided with timing
marks on the flywheel to indicate the positions
of the latter at which the valves of the various
cylinders should open and close. In connection
with these marks a pointer attached to the
crank case and indicating the top of the flywheel
is used. When the line on the flywheel
marked, for example, 4 Ex 0, is under the
pointer, it indicates that the exhaust valve on
the fourth cylinder should be about to open.
If the motor is turned but very little beyond
this point, a lifting should be felt at the proper
push rod or valve stem.</p>

<p>It is well to test the setting of the valves occasionally
by means of these marks, for wear
at the rocker arms, the push rods, the valve
stem, or the cam travelers will result in unevenly-timed
valves. It should be remembered
that it is the valve itself that should open after
the proper mark on the flywheel has been
passed, and that the movement of a long push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
rod is not sufficient evidence that the valve is
beginning to leave its seat. There may be so
great an amount of lost motion between the
push rod, cam, rocker arm, and valve stem that
the flywheel may be turned several degrees beyond
the proper point before this "play" will
be taken up and the valve itself will begin to
move.</p>

<p>Although the timing of a motor may be
given in inches of piston travel beyond a certain
dead center, at which point an exhaust or
inlet valve should open or close, it is generally
expressed in degrees of flywheel revolution.
Suppose, for example, it is said that the inlet
valve should open ten degrees after the beginning
of the suction stroke. This would indicate
that the flywheel should be turned through an
arc of ten degrees from the point at which the
piston is at its upper dead center before the
inlet valve for that particular cylinder should
begin to open. Expressed in terms of flywheel
revolution, the total travel of the piston
during each stroke is 180 degrees, and as in
the proximity of its dead centers the piston
moves but a short distance in comparison with
the size of the arc through which the flywheel
swings, valves may be set very accurately by
this method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>Not all cam shafts for operating the valves
are located in the crank case. On several designs
of motors the cam shaft extends along
the top of the cylinders and is driven by a vertical
shaft and two sets of bevel gears. On
such motors both inlet and exhaust valves are
located in the cylinder heads, and owing to the
proximity of the cam shaft, but short push rods
and valve stems are needed. The valves are
sometimes operated by means of a bell crank
or rocker arm that acts directly against the
cam surface and end of the valve stem.</p>

<p>On some designs a double cam is used which
serves to operate both the inlet and exhaust
valves of the cylinder. The bearings and cams
of such a shaft are generally enclosed in oil and
dustproof casing screwed to the top of the
cylinders. Such a cam shaft should never be
dismounted without first marking intermeshing
teeth of all spur and bevel gears that are concerned
in its operation.</p>

<p>All poppet valves must be accessible and
readily removable for the purpose of cleaning
and grinding the contact surfaces of the head
and seat. The pockets in which the valves
placed at the side of a cylinder are located are
generally provided with large screw plugs at
the top. Such a plug may be removed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
heavy wrench, and as the opening which it
fills is larger than the head of the valve, the
latter may be removed after first loosening the
spiral spring surrounding its stem. It is not
necessary to remove the valve entirely from its
pocket in order to grind its surfaces, but the
pin holding the spring stop in place must be
withdrawn so that the tension of the spring on
the valve will not be so great as to prevent
the latter from being lifted to permit the introduction
of the abrasive and turning the head
with the grinding tool.</p>

<p>Valves located in the head of the cylinder
must be removed entirely before their surfaces
can be ground. This, however, is not a difficult
operation, as the valve and its seat are
generally placed in a removable "cage" that
either screws in place or is held firmly in position
by means of a clamp or like device. Inasmuch
as the seat is contained in this removable
cage in which the valve operates, the grinding
may be done at a work bench or on the bed
of any convenient tool, independently of the
location of the motor.</p>

<p>If a valve seems sluggish in its action at
high speeds of the motor, it is possible that its
spring has become somewhat weakened.
These springs are designed to be exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
stiff and heavy, some of them requiring a pressure
of two hundred and fifty pounds to compress
the coils one inch. With such a spring,
a special tool is required to compress it sufficiently
to enable the valve to be removed. A
spiral spring that has become weakened may
sometimes be strengthened by "stretching,"
but it is not to be supposed that this would be
of great avail in the case of a spring as heavy
as those used on some valves. If, however, a
flat tool is introduced between the various coils
and each is separated slightly so that the ultimate
length of the entire spring is greater than
it was formerly, it will exert a more powerful
force on the valve when it is returned to its
place surrounding the stem.</p>

<p>Stiffening the spring, however, will be of but
little help if the stem or push rod is tight in
the guides through which it slides. These
guides are often made of a special bearing
bronze and are designed to withstand a large
amount of wear, but the friction surfaces must
be lubricated if satisfactory service is to be obtained.
The lower guide is generally lubricated
by the oil from the cams, while the guide
near the valve may receive its oil from the engine
cylinder. It is not necessary that these
guides shall be packed or that they shall be particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
tight, as they are not called upon to
retain any gas or air pressure, but they must
hold the stem and rod sufficiently rigid to prevent
any perceptible side motion and thus cause
imperfect seating of the valve. In replacing
valve stems and push rods, it should be made
certain that each works freely in its guide before
the spring is installed. If there is a slight
tendency for the guide to grip the rod or stem,
the latter should be smoothed with emery
paper at the point at which it comes in contact
with the guide and plenty of oil applied until
the surfaces are well "worked down." As the
distance that the rods and stems travel through
the guides is comparatively short, the wear is
slight and only a small amount of lubricant is
needed, provided the rubbing surfaces are
smooth and well-fitted to each other.</p>

<p>The mechanism of a sleeve valve motor is
slightly different from that of the poppet valve
type. Each sleeve is operated by a connecting
rod and eccentric mounted on a shaft driven
by a chain or gears from the crank shaft of the
motor. The eccentric replaces the cams of the
poppet valve motor, and as it must maintain a
certain relation with the position of the piston
in order that the operation of the valves shall
be timed correctly, the same care must be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
in replacing the eccentric shaft with the
proper teeth of the sprocket or gear in mesh
as has already been described in connection
with the cam shaft of the poppet valve motor.</p>

<span class="smcap small">Bearings</span></h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">In</span> the general meaning of the term, a bearing
is any part that carries weight or pressure
and at the same time rubs over another
surface. According to this definition, the
portion of the cylinder walls traversed by the
pistons are bearings, and that is in reality the
case, but the term has come to be applied more
specifically to the part of the machine in which
another part <em>revolves</em>, either continuously or
intermittently. Thus the portions of the crank
shaft on which it is supported and the parts
of metal in which they revolve combine to form
the crank shaft bearings. The shaft or stud on
which a gear or wheel is mounted and on which
it revolves is the bearing of that gear or wheel.</p>

<p>Although they are concealed, as some six-cylinder
motors may be provided with as many
as three dozen, or more, bearings&mdash;if we consider
those on which the cam, pump, and
magneto shafts and the gears are mounted&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
but what descriptions, rules, and precautions
apply to all hold true in the largest sense when
the crank shaft, connecting rod, and wrist pin
bearings only are considered. It is on this
latter class that the greatest wear of the motor
is concentrated, and the owner who understands
and inspects these need fear no trouble
from the cam shaft and gear bearings.</p>

<p>The expert will judge of the condition of a
motor by the wear that has occurred in the
bearings rather than by any exhibition of temporary
power that it may develop in a short
test, and it is for this reason that the "general
public" runs a risk whenever it buys a
second-hand car that has not been thoroughly
overhauled by a reputable factory or inspected
by a competent engineer. The bearings are in
reality the vitals of the motor, and when these
are worn beyond the point of easy adjustment
or renewal, the repairs necessary to place the
machine in good condition would oftentimes
cost more than the entire engine is worth. But
even in a badly-worn motor, the bearings may
be "taken up" and "doctored" so that, for
a while at least, the engine will seem to run
perfectly and develop its full power. This will
not be for long, however, and soon the motor
will begin to pound, knock, and rattle until an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
examination will bring to light the true condition
of the bearings.</p>

<p>In no machine are the bearings subjected to
more severe usage than in the automobile motor.
In order that the motor car power plant
shall be light in weight and occupy but a small
amount of space, the power must be transmitted
at high speeds. In many an automobile
motor, the pressure imparted to a single bearing
during a certain portion of its revolution
may frequently be well over two tons, and in
this same bearing, the "speed of rubbing" may
approach eight or nine hundred feet per minute.
In other words, at normal speeds of the
motor, about a sixth of a mile of steel surface
will rub over a certain point in each crank shaft
bearing during every minute that the engine is
running.</p>

<p>When properly lubricated, an iron or steel
shaft will run in almost any kind of a metal
bearing that is sufficiently strong to carry the
weights and pressures imposed upon the shaft.
The friction generated between two different
metals that rub against each other, however,
varies according to the composition of those
metals, and consequently it is advisable to employ
some material for a bearing that will offer
a minimum resistance to the turning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
shaft. Friction must be reduced between all
moving surfaces in order that the mechanical
efficiency of the machine shall be high, and it is
in the bearings that a large amount of power
may be absorbed.</p>

<p>But even between the best-lubricated surfaces,
employing the most efficient metal as a
bearing, some wear is bound to occur. The
crank shaft of a four- or a six-cylinder motor
is forged or sawed from one piece of steel,
and with the accurate machining, finishing, and
grinding to which it is subjected, it becomes an
expensive part of the engine. Consequently it
is advisable that the wear of bearings of such
parts shall be restricted to the "boxes" or surrounding
stationary metal in which the shaft
revolves at these points. In order that all wear
shall occur here, rather than in the shaft, the
boxes are made of or lined with a softer metal.
If the crank shaft is of hard steel, the bearing
metal may be of brass or bronze, but it has
been found that babbitt metals give the most
satisfactory service for such conditions&mdash;particularly
as a sufficiently hard crank shaft is
difficult to produce commercially.</p>

<p>Not only is a babbitt metal softer than the
steel of the shaft and consequently receives
practically all the wear of the bearing, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
has the added advantage of melting at comparatively
low temperatures. At first thought,
this may seem like a doubtful advantage, but
in case of a failure of the oil supply to that
bearing, this characteristic may be the means
of saving the crank shaft, and possibly the
crank case, cylinders, and connecting rods,
from rack and ruin.</p>

<p>The purpose of lubrication is to reduce friction
between the two surfaces in contact. Friction
generates heat, and consequently the temperature
of a bearing to which a sufficient supply
of oil is not delivered will be raised to a
very high point. This high temperature will
cause both parts of the bearing to expand, with
the result that the fit becomes very tight and
the shaft binds or "seizes" in its box. This is
the familiar "hot box," so often the bane of
railroad men, and if the shaft is still run under
these conditions, the bearing material will be
torn out and the surface of the shaft, axle, or
whatever the revolving portion happens to be,
will be cut and abraded, oftentimes beyond the
possibility of repair. It is such accidents as
these that are prevented by the use of an easily-melted
babbitt metal.</p>

<p>If the oil supply becomes insufficient so that
the temperature of the bearing is raised above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
a certain point, the babbitt metal will be melted
and will run out of its container before any
damage can be done to the shaft. Efficient
running cannot, of course, be obtained with the
bearing "burned out" in this manner, but the
babbitt is quickly and easily renewed and
serves as a sort of fusible safety valve that
saves many an expensive crank shaft replacement.</p>

<p>Babbitt metals may be of various compositions
and proportions and many contain lead,
but those which have been found to give the
best results for use on the crank shafts of automobile
motors are composed only of tin, antimony,
and copper. If lead is used at all for
this purpose, it should not appear in proportions
above one per cent of the total composition.
Inasmuch as a babbitt metal will fuse
at a comparatively low temperature and is
much softer than steel, it is obvious that such
a material will not withstand heavy pressures
unless reinforced and is unsuited for structural
purposes. Consequently the babbitt is placed
in the bearing box in the form of a thin lining
within which the shaft revolves.</p>

<p>When the shaft is "lined up" in the box, the
hot babbitt metal may be poured in until the
space is entirely filled. When the babbitt cools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the shaft may be turned, and when lubricant
has been introduced in the oil grooves which
should have been provided for the purpose, the
new bearing will be ready for use. It is not to
be expected that the majority of motor car
owners will rebabbitt the crank shaft bearings
themselves, but it is necessary to understand
the general principles of such bearing design
in order to inspect the motor intelligently and
to determine upon the repairs needed.</p>

<p>The above method of renewing "burned
out" bearings applies to babbitts in general,
but the severe usage that automobile engine
crank shaft and connecting rod bearings are
called upon to withstand necessitates the exercise
of a certain amount of additional care.
It is necessary that the box shall fit the shaft
perfectly, so that there can be no "play," and
yet the shaft must be allowed to turn easily
within its surrounding babbitt metal.</p>

<p>As was stated above, the shaft may be easily
loosened from the babbitt metal after the latter
has cooled, and this would form a satisfactory
type of bearing were it not advisable that some
means be supplied by which the wear could be
taken up without renewing the entire babbitt
lining. The bearing boxes of the crank shaft
are each made in two halves, the lower portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
being cast integral with the crank case, while
the upper half is in the form of a separate cap
that may be held in place by two or four bolts.
In this case, it is necessary that the boxes shall
be in two sections, for the shape of the crank
shaft prevents it from being slid into place
lengthwise, and consequently it must be placed
on its bearing from the top. In some designs
of motors the bearing caps form the lower
half of the box, but as in this case the base of
the motor must be inverted in order to remove
the crank shaft, the caps will still be considered
as the "top" halves of the boxes.</p>

<p>There may be dove-tail grooves cut in the
inside of the halves of the boxes to retain the
babbitt metal after it has been poured in place.
Consequently, in order to remove the cap after
renewing the babbitt lining, the babbitt metal
must be cut in two at the joint between the
two halves of the box. The two halves of the
box, instead of fitting closely together, are separated
by thin strips of copper or fiber known
as "shims" that serve to relieve the shaft from
the pressure of the bolts when the bearing cap
is screwed in place. In other words, the two
halves of the box must be held tightly in place
by means of the bolts and nuts, but none of
this pressure should rest on the revolving shaft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
as this would bind it and prevent it from turning
easily. Consequently by "building up" the
space between the two halves with these thin
shims the proper adjustment may be obtained.</p>

<p>These shims provide the method of taking
up the wear in the babbitt that will eventually
result. By loosening the box retaining bolts
and removing the required number of shims,
the halves of the box will be brought closer
together. When the bearing cap is screwed
securely in place, the shaft should be able to
revolve freely without binding, and yet the fit
should be sufficiently tight to prevent any
"play" at right angles to the length of the
shaft.</p>

<p>The pressure of a shaft should not be concentrated
in one place, but should be distributed
over as large a surface of the babbitt
metal as is possible. A few years ago, when
renewing or repairing a bearing, it was considered
sufficient to pour in the molten metal
or to remove the proper number of shims&mdash;and
the bearing was then said to be ready for
its work. But even though no play was apparent,
it was possible that the shaft rested on only
a few portions of the bearing surface; and the
increased attention that is now paid to the
details of automobile construction is no better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
exemplified than in the fact that nearly all
bearings are "scraped" in. This operation is
simple and consists merely in removing any
slight excess babbitt metal so that the lining fits
the shaft throughout its entire length and circumference.
The babbitt is sufficiently soft to
enable it to be peeled or scraped with a sharp
tool provided for the purpose, and no great
degree of skill is necessary in obtaining the
required fit.</p>

<p>In order to determine at exactly what portions
of the babbitt lining the pressure is too
great, a dye or paint known as "blueing" is
used. The bearing portion of the crank shaft
is painted with this, and the cap is then screwed
in place. If the crank shaft is then turned and
the cap removed, it will be found that the
blueing has been transferred from the bearing
to the portions of the babbitt metal on which
the pressure is the greatest. These portions
should then be shaved with the tool mentioned
above, and the same test repeated. As the
excess metal is removed, it will be found that
the blueing gradually is deposited over a larger
area of the babbitt, but it is not to be supposed
that the fit can be made so perfect that the
color will be distributed evenly over the entire
surface. Care should be taken to screw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
bearing cap onto the shims as tightly as possible
each time the blueing test is to be made.</p>

<p>There is nothing that will heat a bearing so
quickly as a poor alignment of the shaft supported
by it. For this reason gasoline engine
crank shafts are made exceptionally strong and
heavy, especially those that are supported only
at their extremities, or at these points and in
the center of their length. A shaft that is
bent or twisted to even the slightest degree
will soon "burn out" all of its bearings, regardless
of the amount of oil that may be fed
to them. This is because of the unequal pressures
on the different sides of the bearing that
allow no room for the admission of the film of
oil or other lubricant that is necessary in all
cases to prevent a "hot box."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the bearings must all be
in perfect alignment, for to set one slightly
"off" would produce the same result as though
the shaft were bent. It will be seen that the
use of babbitt produces a "self-aligning" bearing,
for the straight shaft may be set in its
proper position and the molten metal poured
around the interior of the boxes.</p>

<p>As it is highly important that the cap screws
or nuts holding the bearing cap in place should
remain set as tightly as possible, precautions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
must be taken to prevent any of these from
working loose. This may be done by means
of a cotter pin that passes through a hole in
each bolt and through a pair of corresponding
notches cut in the top of opposite faces of the
nut. A notch is generally cut in the top of each
face of the nut in order that the latter may be
held securely in place in any position. A continuous
wire passing through all of the bolts
and nuts is sometimes used instead of the individual
cotter pins.</p>

<p>Many modern automobile motors are designed
with the crank shaft running in ball
bearings. The type generally used consists of
a row of balls set between the inner and outer
edges of two concentric rings. The inside of
the outer and the outside of the inner ring
are grooved, constituting the ball "race"
which forms the surface upon which the balls
roll and which, at the same time, serves to hold
them in place. Each ball of the same bearing
must be made of exactly the same size as its
companions&mdash;or at least within one or two ten-thousandths
of an inch&mdash;and each one must be
large enough and of sufficient strength to withstand,
by itself, the entire pressure in that bearing.
The inner ring slips over the bearing
portion of the shaft with a comparatively tight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
fit, while the outer ring remains stationary in
its bed in the crank case.</p>

<p>The inner ring turns with the shaft, thus
causing the balls to roll in their race. Each
ball rolls about its own axis, and the entire
series describes a circular motion in the same
direction as that taken by the shaft, but considerably
slower. Consequently there is no
rubbing in such a bearing, all the motion being
of the rolling type, and as this reduces friction
to a minimum, the balls may be run without oil,
although lubrication of the proper kind would
certainly not harm the bearing. Ball bearings
are adapted only for a two-bearing crank shaft,
for inasmuch as the rings must be slipped over
the shaft, it would be manifestly impossible to
provide a ball bearing in the center, or in any
other portion beyond a crank.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the main bearings of
a crank shaft are those by which the connecting
rods communicate their motion to the
cranks. These are known as the crank pin
bearings or the "big end" of the connecting
rod bearings. But inasmuch as the upper, or
smaller, end of the connecting rods are termed
the wrist-pin bearings, the other end may be
called simply the connecting rod bearing.</p>

<p>The connecting rod bearings are similar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the main bearings described in the foregoing
pages and are renewed and adjusted in the
same manner. It is probable, however, that
these receive a greater amount of wear than
do the main bearings, inasmuch as the former
obtain the direct impact of the force of each
explosion. Furthermore, the box of the connecting
rod bearing describes a complete circle
with each revolution of the crank shaft, in
addition to the "internal rotation" of the
crank, while an alternate push and pull is delivered
to it by the connecting rod on its various
strokes.</p>

<p>Consequently it is the connecting rod bearings
that will become loose and require "taking
up" before any attention need be bestowed on
the main bearings. The wear will increase in
the connecting rod bearing as the play becomes
greater, and if matters are not remedied, the
box may eventually be broken, with the result
that the end of the connecting rod thus freed
will start on the "rampage" and will punch
several pieces out of the bottom of the crank
case.</p>

<p>Brass or bronze bearings may be used at
the big end of the connecting rods, but the
large majority of motor car engines are provided
with babbitted bearings at these points.
It is especially necessary that these bearings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
should be scraped to a perfect fit and that the
shims should be adjusted properly so that no
side play will be apparent when the connecting
rod is moved transversely to the length of the
crank shaft. When renewing the babbitts of
connecting rod bearings care should be taken
to allow the connecting rod to swing free before
the molten metal is poured in. If this
is not done, the connecting rod may be forced
slightly to one side or the other and will be
held permanently in this position when the babbitt
cools. This will induce a slight side thrust
in the connecting rod, which will be communicated
to the piston, with the result that the
side of the latter and of the portion of the
cylinder wall against which it moves will be
scored and worn unduly.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the connecting rod bearings are
subjected to such a variety of strains, and as
looseness at these points will result in serious
wear, it is doubly necessary that the nuts and
bolts holding the bearing caps in place should
be securely wired or held tightly by means of
the previously-mentioned cotter pins. It is evident
that the base of the large end of the
connecting rod forms the upper half of the
bearing box, while the cap constitutes the lower
end and is attached from the bottom.</p>

<p>The connecting rod bearings on some motors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
are hinged at one side so that the cap may be
turned away from the crank shaft when it is
desired to remove the connecting rod. In this
case the hinge replaces the one or two bolts
or nuts on one side of the box and is held in
the proper position by those on the other side.
While it may be easier to adjust a bearing
provided with such a cap, the results obtained
can hardly be expected to be as satisfactory for
high-grade service, as is the case when the
shims may be used on both sides of the two
halves of the bearing.</p>

<p>The wrist-pin bearing is located at the upper,
or small, end of each connecting rod, and,
although it also carries the full force of each
explosion, it is not subjected to as great wear
as is the bearing at the other end of the connecting
rod. The reason for this is that this
bearing does not revolve and its friction surface
is reduced to the comparatively small arc
through which the connecting rod swings.
Wear can occur here, however, and because
this bearing is more inaccessible than is the
crank shaft or connecting rod bearing, trouble
at the wrist pin is often overlooked.</p>

<p>The wrist pin can only be reached by the
removal of the piston and connecting rod. In
the majority of designs the wrist pin is placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
in the sides of the piston and is held stationary
by small keys or by set screws. In this case,
the bearing surface is formed by the wrist pin
and the small end of the connecting rod, at
which point the greatest wear occurs. This
bearing is never babbitted, but in order to
reduce the wear on the wrist pin&mdash;which is
generally made of hardened steel&mdash;the circular
opening in the upper end of the connecting rod
is lined with a bronze or brass bushing that
forms a bearing fit over the wrist pin. It is
this lining, or bushing, that will wear rather
than the hardened steel wrist pin, but as the
former is easily removed and is not expensive
to replace, the renewal of this bearing is a comparatively
simple matter.</p>

<p>In other types of wrist pin bearings, the pin
is held stationary in the connecting rod opening
and turns with it as the connecting rod swings
through its arc on each stroke of the piston.
With such a design, the bearing surface is
formed by each end of the wrist pin and the
openings in the sides of the piston walls in
which the wrist pin rests. In order to form
an easily-replaced bearing surface, these openings
in the piston walls are lined with brass or
bronze bushings that receive the major part of
the wear, as has been described in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
with the bushings fitted to the opening at the
small end of the connecting rod.</p>

<p>There is nothing complicated or mysterious
connected with the renewal or repair of bearings,
but the man who makes such replacements
or adjustments must be an accurate and careful
worker, and while he need not be a "born
machinist," he must at least possess the
"knack" of handling tools properly. And he
must, above all, realize that the designers and
manufacturers of his motor have been dealing
in measurements of the thousandth part of an
inch and that too great care cannot be taken in
the repair of bearings to obtain a perfect fit.</p>

<p>If he is renewing a connecting rod or a wrist
pin bearing, he must also remember that the
piston has formerly been traveling over a certain
area of cylinder surface that has not varied
in length the ten-thousandth part of an inch
between one stroke and the next. Consequently,
the babbitts or bushings should be
so replaced that the piston shall occupy the
same position relative to the cylinder walls at
the top and bottom of its stroke that it did
formerly. In other words, by varying the
thickness of the top of the babbitt he is replacing,
he may change the "center" of the bearing
so that the piston will start on its upward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
stroke from a different point than was previously
the case. Thus, while the length of
travel of the piston will be the same, it will
traverse a slightly different portion of the
cylinder walls under the new conditions, and
this will have the effect of changing the compression
and, possibly, of wearing the piston
and rings unduly.</p>

<span class="smcap small">The Ignition System</span></h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">It</span> was the application of the electric current
to the ignition system of the gasoline
engine that first enabled these new forms
of power plants to be designed with sufficient
compactness and to possess enough flexibility
to render their use practical on self-propelled
vehicles. Without the electric ignition system,
the speed and power of the vehicle could not
well be controlled, and the explosions would
be uncertain and irregular, at best.</p>

<p>Those of us who are familiar with the electric
gas lighters that were in popular use a few
years ago are furnished with a convincing
demonstration of the operation of the first
electric ignition systems. By pulling a chain, a
wire, or arm was rubbed across a metal point
until the contact thus formed was suddenly
broken. This arm and the stationary point
formed the two terminals of an electric circuit,
which caused a flash of blue flame when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
contact was broken as the one was "wiped"
across the other. The flame thus formed at
the instant the contact was broken contained
sufficient heat to ignite the gas escaping from
the burner to which the device was attached.</p>

<p>Sparks will be formed in the same manner
if we hold two wires, connected to the opposite
poles of a set of batteries, in both hands and
wipe the bare ends across each other. If an
arrangement producing this effect is introduced
into the gas engine cylinder at the portion in
which the charge is compressed, the flash resulting
when the terminals are separated will
serve to ignite the explosive mixture. The
movable terminal is connected to a rod which
passes through the cylinder walls and is attached
to a mechanism actuated by a cam revolved
by the engine. This mechanism is
termed the "make-and-break" ignition system
for the reason that contact of these terminals
is alternately made and broken to produce
the flash of electricity that explodes the
surrounding charge.</p>

<p>In order to produce a flash of sufficient size
when the contact is broken, the nature of the
current, obtained from the dry cells or storage
battery is changed somewhat by conducting it
through a coil of wire surrounding a bundle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
bare copper wires. This is known as a spark
coil, and while it is generally used with battery
ignition of the make-and-break type, magnetos
may be designed which produce the proper
kind of current direct, without the aid of the
coil.</p>

<p>An ordinary set of six dry cells, connected in
series&mdash;or like with unlike poles&mdash;will produce
a current of between twenty and twenty-five
amperes at a pressure of about nine volts&mdash;assuming
each battery, when new, to deliver
twenty-five amperes at a pressure of one and
one-half volts. The "series" wiring gives the
entire set the combined voltage of all with the
average amperage of one. For the benefit of
those who have forgotten their elementary
physics, let it be remembered that the ampere
is the measure of current <em>amount</em>, or flow, while
the voltage is concerned only with the <em>pressure</em>
of the current. By the use of various arrangements
of windings of wires, the voltage may be
raised with a corresponding decrease in the
amperage&mdash;and vice versa. Thus, if a coil is
used that doubles the original number of amperes
produced by the battery, the voltage will
be halved.</p>

<p>The make-and-break type of ignition has
been used successfully for many years, but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the perfection of the magneto, it has been
largely supplanted, in automobile practice, at
least, by the "jump spark," or "high-tension"
system. Because of the fact that the latter system
is less expensive to construct and is highly
efficient, it will be found also on the majority
of the older cars not equipped with a magneto.</p>

<p>It was found, after the general adoption of
the make-and-break ignition system, that a
flame was not necessary for the combustion of
a properly-mixed charge in the engine cylinder.
In fact, a tiny spark, scarcely one-sixteenth of
an inch long and no larger around than a pin,
was discovered to be sufficient to produce the
ignition of the charge. Although, of small
volume, such a spark generates intense heat,
and it is upon this quality, rather than upon
area, that the charge depends for its ignition&mdash;although
it is claimed that a large flame will
produce more complete, rapid, and consequently
more efficient, combustion. But the
jump spark possesses the advantage of requiring
no moving parts projecting through the
cylinder walls into the combustion chamber,
and its greater simplicity over that of the make-and-break
system has resulted in its almost universal
adoption by automobile manufacturers.</p>

<p>It has been stated in a preceding paragraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
that the voltage produced by the average battery
set will not exceed nine or ten, and even
the pressure generated by the ordinary magneto
is not greater than this. But air is not a good
conductor of electricity and forms a very high
resistance to the passage of a current. It is
only when the high resistance of an air gap is
encountered in its circuit, however, that a spark
will be formed by the current, and consequently
the form of electricity used in this system must
have resistance-overcoming properties. But it
is only by raising the voltage of the current
that even a short air gap can be bridged by the
spark. In fact, a pressure of somewhat over
fifty thousand volts is required to produce a
spark less than an inch long in the air.</p>

<p>Although only called upon to jump a gap
about a sixteenth of an inch across, the ordinary
high-tension current is capable of bridging
a space eight or ten times this width in order
that ample pressure will always be assured for
the formation of the spark. Furthermore, the
warm gases in which the spark is formed in the
cylinder increase the resistance ordinarily encountered
and it is consequently necessary to
raise the voltage above the amount that would
be needed were the plug exposed to the open
air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>These conditions make advisable a pressure
of from twelve thousand to thirty thousand
volts in the ordinary jump spark system, and
it is from this voltage that the term "high
tension" is obtained. The nine or ten volts
delivered by the batteries are transformed to
this larger amount by means of an induction
coil&mdash;or what is more generally termed merely
the "coil." This is in reality a "step-up"
transformer, since it transforms the current
from one of low voltage to another of two or
three thousand times its original pressure.</p>

<p>This transformer consists of two coils of
wire, one surrounding the other. The inner
coil is composed of a comparatively few number
of turns of rather coarse wire wound
around a soft iron core, and is termed the
"primary" winding, since the current from
the batteries is led directly through it. The
outer coil is composed of many turns of a very
fine wire, all of which are thoroughly insulated
from each other and from the inner winding.
This outer coil is termed the "secondary"
winding and is the one from which the high-tension,
or transformed, current is taken.</p>

<p>This secondary current is "induced" from
the primary winding through which the battery
current passes and possesses a voltage that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
increased over its original amount in the same
proportion that the number of turns in the secondary
winding bears to those in the primary.
Therefore, if the original battery voltage is
ten and there are a thousand times as many
turns in the secondary winding as in the primary,
the resulting high-tension current will have
a pressure of ten thousand volts.</p>

<p>The principle of the coil is dependent entirely
upon that peculiar electric property
known as "induction." Around every wire
through which an electric current passes are
invisible "lines of force" similar to those that
emanate from an electro-magnet. These lines
of force surround the wire throughout its
length, and arrange themselves in a spiral formation.
Insulation has no effect on these lines
of force, and they may be collected from wires
which are separated from each other by several
thicknesses of current-confining material.
It is, of course, necessary to use insulated wires
in the construction of these coils, for otherwise
the current would merely pass to adjoining
turns and would not travel the entire length of
the winding&mdash;and therefore as great a number
of lines could not be collected.</p>

<p>If an additional layer or layers of wire is
wound around the first series of turns, the lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
of force will be collected, or "induced," by this
second coil, and will constitute the secondary
current. The induction effect is greatly increased
if the primary current is allowed to accumulate,
or "pile up," and discharge, alternately,
for this surging of the current creates
a sort of "overflow" from the original containing
wires.</p>

<p>Ohm's Law, which states that the number of
amperes in an electric circuit is equal to the
voltage divided by the number of ohms of
resistance encountered, shows that the current
will be changed by its passage through the
primary winding. The induced current is further
changed, and when collected by the secondary
winding and sent through its long coils,
we have the high-tension circuit mentioned in
the preceding paragraph.</p>

<p>If the reader remembers that it is but one
hundred and ten volts that is used to operate
our electric lights and that five hundred will
run a trolley car, he may wonder why it is not
dangerous to handle as great a pressure as the
thirty thousand volts that are used in connection
with the ignition system of a motor car.
But it is the combination of great voltage with
high amperage that is dangerous, and if it is
remembered that, as the former is increased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the latter is reduced correspondingly, it will
be realized that the ordinary high-tension ignition
current possesses a <em>quantity</em>, or flow, of
scarcely one one-hundredth of an ampere.</p>

<p>If we liken the electric current to a flow of
water in a pipe, we have the amperes corresponding
to the quantity of the flow, or the number
of gallons that will be delivered at the outlet
in a given time. Continuing this analogy,
the voltage of the electric current will be the
pressure, or "head" in the water system, and
the current from the batteries before the coil
is reached will correspond to a moderate flow
of water at a comparatively low pressure. After
the coil has transformed the current to the
high voltage, we have the conditions of a very
small opening in the water pipe containing a
tremendous pressure. Such a stream will possess
but small flow, but its high pressure will
enable it to be "squirted" to a far greater distance
than would be the case were its volume
larger and its "head" less. Although the
pressure is high, its quantity is so low that the
stream can do but little damage and would
scarcely more than tickle the flesh of a person
against whom it is directed.</p>

<p>Thus it is with the ignition current. It can
"tickle," rather viciously, sometimes, as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
persons will aver, but the <em>amount</em> of electricity
involved is so slight as to render the high pressure
harmless. Nevertheless, it is well to avoid
allowing the fingers or the arm to become a
part of the high-tension circuit, for the result
may be startling as well as annoying.</p>

<p>But in order that the high voltage shall be
induced in the secondary coil, the primary circuit
must be alternately made and broken
between one stroke and the next. Consequently
proper "piling up," or "surging," of the current
will be effected. This is accomplished by
means of an "interrupter" that either vibrates
rapidly or "snaps" once at the formation of
each spark. The former is the more common
type used with battery ignition and is known
as a vibrating coil. A circuit breaker is generally
incorporated in the mechanism of a
magneto, and consequently when such an instrument
is used, the vibrator on the coil is
dispensed with. It is the vibrator on each coil
that forms the "buzz" that can be heard
whenever the box cover is removed, and that
often furnishes a simple test for determining
the condition of the ignition system of the particular
cylinder with which that coil is connected.</p>

<p>The vibrator is a flat, spring steel piece that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
rests near one end of the soft iron core around
which the primary coil is wound. The springy
nature of the vibrator ordinarily holds it
against a small, adjustable contact point that
should be set about an eighth of an inch from
the end of the above-mentioned soft iron core.
The primary coil is so wired that its current
passes through the vibrator steel and the contact
point against which it rests. As soon as
the current travels through the coil surrounding
the soft iron core, however, the latter becomes
magnetized and draws the steel vibrator
toward it. This breaks the circuit, the magnetism
of the iron core disappears, and the
vibrator returns to its original position against
its contact point. But this action again forms
the circuit, and the same operation is repeated
as long as the current is allowed to flow toward
the coil.</p>

<p>This is the same principle on which an electric
bell is rung, but the vibrator of the coil
makes and breaks the circuit much more
rapidly on account of the less weight of the
moving parts. This vibration of the coil interrupter
is so rapid&mdash;hundreds a second probably&mdash;that
the resulting spark is practically
continuous and shows no effect of the breaks
in the circuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>Even though it is the primary current, of
low voltage, that is interrupted by the vibrator,
the frequency of these interruptions causes a
slight sparking, or arcing, at the contact points.
These are therefore subjected to rather a high
degree of heat, as well as a large amount of
wear, and it is necessary that they be made of
a material that will resist both. Platinum has
been found to be unusually suitable for this
purpose, but owing to its high cost, only a
small amount in the form of two points, or
"buttons," is used. One of these points is
placed in the vibrator steel, and the other is
embedded in the end of the screw against which
the first rests. Thus the actual contact is made
against these heat-and-wear-resisting platinum
points, and it is evident that upon their proper
action depends the formation of the spark in
the cylinder with which that particular vibrator
is connected.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that platinum possesses
high heat-resisting properties, the constant
arcing at the contact points will eventually
form a sort of corrosion in which minute
particles of the material are carried from
one point to the other in the direction in which
the current flows. If the current is reversed,
the corrosion will take place in the other direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and consequently the platinum point
that formerly lost a part of its material will
gradually be "built up" again. This corrosive
action is known as "pitting," and while it
may be reduced to a certain extent by reversing
the terminals of the battery, as described, the
platinum will occasionally require additional
attention.</p>

<p>A coil having badly pitted contact points on
the vibrator will "stick" and will cease to
form a spark regularly. It is often difficult to
distinguish between trouble arising from badly-pitted
contact points and that caused by weak
or nearly-exhausted batteries, as either ailment
produces the same symptoms of irregular running
and "jerking" in the motor. For this
reason, a volt and ampere meter for measuring
the pressure and amount of the current delivered
by the batteries should form a part of
every automobile owner's tool equipment.</p>

<p>It is the amperage, rather than the voltage,
that is reduced through continued use of the
batteries, and when this quantity falls below
nine or ten, the cells should be discarded&mdash;or
recharged, in the case of a storage battery.
But if the ignition occurs irregularly when the
batteries are delivering the proper amount of
current, it is probable that the trouble lies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the pitted condition of the platinum contact
points of the vibrator of the coil. Fine emery
cloth rubbed over the surfaces of contact
should serve to remedy matters. It should be
made certain that the resulting surfaces on the
platinum points are not only rubbed smooth,
but level, as well, in order that the entire area
of each will rest in contact and the current will
not be concentrated at a small portion.</p>

<p>It is probable that there will be a screw adjustment
on the vibrator by means of which
the force with which the latter rests against
its contact point may be regulated. If the vibrator
is set too tight, an undue amount
of current will be required to magnetize the
core of the coil sufficiently to pull the vibrator
away from its contact point, and the batteries
will soon "run out." On the other hand, the
tension of the vibrator should be sufficient to
enable it to spring away from the core of the
coil as soon as the circuit is broken, for otherwise
the vibrator will lag and will not be as
"lively" as is necessary to obtain the best results.</p>

<p>The contact screw should be set so that the
vibrator rests <em>about</em> three-thirty-seconds of an
inch from the end of the magnetic core. After
the tension of the vibrator has been set to approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the proper amount, the ear must
be trusted for the correct adjustment of the
contact screw. When the switch is thrown on
and the motor turned until current flows
through the coil, the resulting buzz emanating
from the vibrator should be decided and forceful.
If this buzz is exceedingly high-pitched,
it is an indication that the vibrator has been set
too tight, and its tension should be loosened
if unscrewing the contact point slightly does
not lower the tone. It must be remembered
that the tension of the vibrator can be changed
by turning the contact screw. If this screw is
turned down so that it forces the vibrator toward
the iron core, the tension will be greater
than will be the case if the contact point is
turned to the left.</p>

<p>If the buzz of the vibrator is pitched lower
than was formerly the case, it is an indication
that the contact point should be screwed down,
or that the tension of the vibrator should be
tightened. It is probable that turning the contact
screw to the right will produce the proper
result. While these changes in the position of
the contact screw are being made, the switch
should be left turned on so that the variations
in the pitch of the vibrator buzz may be detected.
When an evenly-pitched, vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
buzz has been secured, the switch should be
thrown on and off several times to make certain
that the response of the vibrator is instant
and positive. The switch should then
be left on and the vibrator allowed to buzz
for several seconds in order that it may be determined
whether the pitch of the sound will
change, or not. If there is a change noticeable,
the contact screw should be readjusted until
the pitch of the buzz remains constant as long
as the circuit is closed.</p>

<p>The coil and batteries or magneto by no
means form the entire ignition system, although
the generation of the spark depends entirely
upon them. The spark must be regulated
to occur at the proper point in the stroke
of the piston, as a continuous spark would not
only waste the current, but would cause the
ignition of the charge during the upward
stroke and would result in an impulse in the
reverse direction that would prevent the motor
from running for more than half a turn.</p>

<p>The device by which the time of the occurrence
of the spark is regulated is called the
timer. This consists, in its essentials, of a
hard rubber disc provided with a copper or
brass segment. A metal pin, roller, or ball
rests against the outer edge of the disc, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
as the latter is revolved, the electrical circuit
is completed whenever the two metal portions
come in contact with each other. The hard
rubber being a non-conductor of electricity,
prevents the flow of the current at all other
times. The disc of the timer, known as the
"commutator," is so geared that it revolves
in unison with the motor.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the explosion occurs in each
cylinder only at every second stroke of a four-cycle
motor, the commutator on this type of
engine is geared to revolve at one-half the
speed of the crank shaft. In the two-cycle motor,
on the other hand, the explosion occurs in
each cylinder at every revolution, and consequently
the commutator should turn at crank
shaft speed.</p>

<p>Although the spark is intended to occur approximately
at the extreme upper end of the
compression stroke, a few degrees variation
both above and below this point is necessary
in order to obtain the desired speed and power
flexibility of the gasoline motor. At high
speeds, the spark should be timed to occur before
the piston reaches the extreme top of its
stroke, while at slower revolutions of the motor
the ignition should take place, in some instances,
just after the piston has started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
to descend. This variation In timing is obtained
by swinging the contact piece of the
timer&mdash;known as the brush&mdash;either forward
or backward through an arc corresponding to
the range of advance and retard.</p>

<p>If this brush is swung in a direction opposite
to that of the revolution of the commutator,
the metal portions will meet sooner, with the
result that the spark will occur earlier, or will
be "advanced." If, however, the brush is
swung to a point farther along in the direction
of rotation of the commutator, the spark will
occur later, or will be "retarded." These
variations of position of the brush are generally
obtained by means of a lever attached to
the steering post or wheel.</p>

<p>It is evident that the current must pass from
the brush to the metal segment of the commutator
in order to complete the circuit through
the timer and thus form the spark. It is the
primary current, or low-tension current from
the battery or magneto, that passes through
the timer, and as this is of low voltage and is
therefore easily discouraged, it is necessary
that the contact points be kept clean in order
that its travel may be made easy. Timers are
generally protected from dirt, but the particles
that will naturally be worn off from the metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and rubber commutator and brush should be
cleaned out before its accumulation becomes
deposited on the contact points and interferes
with perfect electrical connection.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the majority of battery ignition
systems employed a separate coil for
each cylinder of the motor. Each coil in this
system is connected with an individual brush
that operates against the same commutator as
do the brushes for the other cylinders. With
such a system, the primary circuit leads from
one terminal of the battery to the primary
winding of the coil, through this and the vibrator
to the brush of the timer reserved for
that particular coil and cylinder, and thence
through the switch to the other terminal of the
battery. This order may be reversed, or the
timer, switch, and coil may be placed in any
consecutive position, provided the current
passes through all in its travel from one terminal
of the battery to the other. The secondary,
or high-tension current is led from the
terminal of the secondary winding on the coil
to the spark plug of the proper cylinder.
There should be a "ground" wire to serve for
the return of the secondary current. This may
lead from any part of the primary circuit to a
clean metal connection on the motor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>The multiple coil system is still used to a
large extent, but an elaboration of it will be
found on many of the modern cars. This consists
of the use of but a single coil for all of
the cylinders of the motor. This is done by
means of a distributor, which is a sort of
"glorified timer" consisting of a commutator
provided with as many segments as there are
cylinders in the motor. This distributor receives
the current from a single coil and delivers
it to the proper cylinder as the various
connections are made. The timer still performs
its function of completing the circuit
from the source of current only at the proper
instant, and leaves the distributor to serve the
purpose of a "switch" to "sidetrack" the
current and deliver it at the various cylinders
in turn.</p>

<p>If it should ever become necessary to remove
any part of the timer, or to change the
length of the spark control rods, the greatest
care should be taken to make certain that the
motor is properly timed when the various portions
are replaced. This can best be done by
setting the spark lever in its central position,
removing a plug from one of the cylinders, and
introducing a rod or long screw driver into the
opening for the purpose of determining the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
top of the stroke of the piston. When the
flywheel is turned, the top of the stroke should
be marked on the rod or screw driver as the
latter is forced upward by the piston.</p>

<p>If the spark plug is laid with its large nut
resting on the cylinder head, and the switch
is thrown, the time of the occurrence of the
spark can be readily observed as the motor is
turned slowly by hand. This spark should occur
in this particular plug just as the piston of
that cylinder reaches the top of its stroke, as
indicated by the change in the direction of the
movement of the rod or screw driver. If the
spark occurs too soon or too late, the commutator
should be moved backward or forward to
remedy the respective trouble. Although if the
timer is set properly for one cylinder it is
probable that the spark in the others is also
timed correctly, it is well to test each to make
certain that there has been no uneven wear in
the contact segments of the commutator or the
brush.</p>

<span class="smcap small">Magnetos</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> perfection of the magneto and its
application to cars of all classes and
sizes has marked the most important
step in gasoline motor ignition since the introduction
of the electric spark. The magneto is
now considered one of the most vital parts of
the car, and while it is possible for the motor
to be run for many miles on the batteries that
form the auxiliary ignition sources, the
mechanical current generator has left the field
of the desirable accessories and has become an
actual, physical portion of the engine.</p>

<p>The operation of the magneto is simple, its
whys and wherefores are logical, and if one investigates
the subject, even superficially, he will
discover that the much-maligned machine seldom
gives trouble, and that when it does, such
action, or failure to act, is due to neglect,
abuse, or some other perfectly legitimate reason,
rather than "pure cussedness" on the
part of the instrument itself. If the mere mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
aspect is considered; if it is realized
that the magneto consists mainly of a bundle
of wires which, when revolved near the ends
of a magnet, collects that magnetism and sends
it through the circuit in the form of the electric
current, and that consequently the magneto is
a converter that changes part of the mechanical
energy of the motor into the spark-forming
fluid, the chief idea of magneto principles may
be more easily grasped.</p>

<p>To be sure, the magneto is delicate, and for
that reason it should never be dissected by the
amateur, but inasmuch as what few adjustments
it has are readily accessible, it is seldom
that the machine need to be taken apart. The
platinum points of the contact breaker, usually
located in the small box on the end of the
armature shaft, may need to be smoothed with
emery paper occasionally if they have become
pitted from excessive sparking, but this is a
simple operation and is not greatly different
from the care given to the vibrator of the
dashboard spark coil, as described in the <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">preceding
chapter</a>.</p>

<p>A few drops of oil should be fed to the
lubricating cups or holes of the armature shaft
as often as the directions call for&mdash;usually
about once every five hundred miles&mdash;but aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
from this, the owner can generally forget that
he has a magneto, and will only be reminded
of the fact by the pleasing absence of ignition
trouble. If ignition trouble does occur, it is
more than probable that the fault lies with the
plugs, timer, or wires, rather than with the
magneto.</p>

<p>The man who drives a magneto-equipped
car knows that the current producer is run by
a gear connected, either directly or through
the medium of other gears with the crank shaft
of the motor. He knows, then, that the magneto
is driven positively and that there is a
constant relation between its speed and the
number of revolutions of the motor.</p>

<p>But does he know that it is absolutely necessary
that a certain position of the armature
shall always correspond with a similar position
of the crank shaft of the motor, and that consequently
the same teeth of the driving gears
must always mesh? He will most assuredly
be made aware of this if he disconnects his
magneto and then fails to replace the gears so
that exactly the same teeth are in mesh, for
even the difference of a single tooth between
the normal positions of the armature and crank
shaft will prevent the magneto from delivering
a sufficient spark to enable the motor to run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>The reason for this is simple. All of these
direct-driven magnetos are of the alternating
current type, as this form allows of the
simplest construction of armature and windings.
The alternating current generator obtains
its name from the fact that there are no
regularly-defined north and south poles at any
part of the circuit, as these keep changing continuously,
or alternating.</p>

<p>During each revolution of the armature of
the alternating current magneto, there are but
two positions at which a current will be formed.
Now the spark in any cylinder of a motor is
required at about the top of the compression
stroke of the piston in that cylinder. Consequently
when the piston is at the top of its
compression stroke, ready for the spark that
will ignite the charge, the armature of the magneto
must be in one of its two current-generating
positions, and there must therefore be a
constant relation between the position of the
crank shaft, to which each piston is connected,
and that of the revolving part of the magneto.</p>

<p>If, now, the driving gear of the magneto is
returned to its place without regard to the
teeth of the next gear with which it meshes,
it will be seen that the proper relation between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the position of the armature and that of the
crank shaft will not be maintained. Under
these conditions, when the piston is at the top
of the compression stroke, ready for the spark,
the armature will not be in a position at which
a current can be generated, and there can consequently
be no spark formed at the plug.
Conversely, when the armature has been revolved
to the position at which a current will
be formed, none of the pistons will be requiring
the spark, and this consequent lack of
"team work" will prevent the operation of
the motor.</p>

<p>In order to maintain this team work between
the armature of the magneto and the
crank shaft of the motor, the intermeshing
teeth of the gears should be marked with a
prick punch before they are removed, so that
they may be returned to their proper place
without trouble. Only in this manner can accurate
results be obtained, if it is at any time
necessary to remove all or part of the magneto
driving gear.</p>

<p>The magnets forming the "fields" of the
magneto in which the armature revolves are of
the permanent kind; that is, they do not depend
upon windings and a separate electric current
for their excitation, as is the case with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of the larger generators. These magnets may
be considered to be the most faithful part of
the machine, for they generally retain their
strength under all conditions of rest or work,
and it is upon them that the proper operation
of the magneto largely depends.</p>

<p>A magneto in which the magnets have become
weakened is useless for ignition purposes
until the fields can be remagnetized, and as this
can only be done at the factory, the machine in
its entirety must be removed from the motor.
It is a comparatively easy matter to determine
whether or not the fields have lost their magnetism
by placing a piece of iron or steel within
close range of the base or sides of the magneto.
An appreciable pull will be exerted by
the magnets if they still retain their strength,
although it is not to be supposed that the force
thus exhibited will be very vigorous from such
a small machine.</p>

<p>If the magneto has been disconnected from
its driving gear for any reason, the amount of
magnetism remaining in the fields will be best
determined by turning the armature shaft with
the hand. A resistance should be offered to
the turning at first until a certain point is
reached, after which the armature should exhibit
a strong tendency to fly forward to a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
position, one hundred and eighty degrees beyond
its former normal position of rest. This
activity of the armature is one of the best
guides to the amount of magnetism remaining
in the fields.</p>

<p>Many magnetos that have been installed on
old motor cars not previously so equipped are
of the friction-driven, direct-current type that
produces a uniform spark at any point throughout
the armature revolution. Current from
these may be used to charge a storage battery
for the operation of electric lights or to supply
auxiliary ignition current for starting. The
positively-driven, alternating-current magneto
may also be used to operate electric lights on
the car, but this type of current cannot be
stored in a battery, and consequently the lights
are available only when the motor is running.
The magneto, however, is not primarily an
electric-lighting outfit, and unless it is especially
designed for the double purpose, a separate
machine should generally be used for supplying
illuminating current.</p>

<span class="smcap small">Carburetors And Their Fuel</span></h2>


<p class="cap3"><span class="upper">Although</span> gasoline is inflammable in
its liquid state, its combustion is not sufficiently
rapid to approach the <em>explosive</em>
point necessary to render its energy available
in the automobile engine cylinder. The proper
proportion of gasoline <em>vapor</em> and air, however,
forms a mixture that is highly inflammable and
that will be entirely consumed in the engine
cylinder under ordinary conditions within
about one-twentieth of a second after the
formation of the spark. This rapid combustion
so nearly approaches the instantaneous
action of an explosion that it may be considered
as such in all ordinary discussions of
the gasoline engine. Literally, however, the
gasoline engine is not an <em>explosion</em> motor, but
rather is it an engine of the <em>internal combustion</em>
type. To obtain this gasoline vapor in an
easily-controlled form the carburetor was designed
as one of the most important adjuncts of
the automobile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>The first form of carburetors, or "vaporizers,"
as they were called then, employed a
flat, woven lamp wick over which the gasoline
flowed. This spread the fuel out over a comparatively
large surface and rendered evaporation
rapid and simple. The chamber containing
this wick was placed in the line of the intake
pipe of the motor and was connected with
the cylinders on the descent of the pistons on
the suction stroke through the medium of the
various inlet valves. In a four-cycle motor, the
piston acts as a suction pump on alternate
down-strokes and serves to draw the charge
into the cylinder. This suction created the
necessary current of air to facilitate evaporation
of the gasoline on the wick, and by regulating
the size of the passages, the proper proportion
of air and gasoline vapor could be obtained.</p>

<p>The modern, high-speed automobile motor,
with its varying demands upon the carburetor,
created the necessity for a more delicate, flexible,
and compact vaporizer than was to be
found in the "lamp wick" type. Consequently
the wick was replaced by a small, slender, hollow
tube having a cone-shaped opening at its
upper end through which the gasoline from the
feed pipe was made to pass. Fitting into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
upper end of this tube, and pointed to the same
angle, was a cone-shaped "needle" that could
be moved in and out of the opening. If this
needle was unscrewed slightly so that it did not
form a tight fit with the end of the tube, a
small ring would be formed through which the
gasoline must pass when sucked by the alternate
down strokes of the pistons. This tube
and needle constitute, under various guises, the
"needle valve" with which practically every
modern carburetor is equipped.</p>

<p>When the gasoline, rushing through the
small tube, strikes the restricted opening of the
needle valve, it is broken up into a fine spray
which, under proper conditions, will become
vaporized almost as soon as it comes in contact
with a current of air. This air current
is induced by the same pump-like effect of the
pistons as that which sucks the gasoline
through the needle valve, and thus it occurs
only when the charge is desired in the cylinders.</p>

<p>But the carburetor is not merely to provide
a compact device for vaporizing the gasoline,
for it must also furnish a means of regulating
the proportion of gas to air. Gasoline vapor
is only highly inflammable when mixed with
the proper quantity of air, and if this proportion
is varied above one limit or below another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
ignition of the charge will not occur in
the cylinders. In fact, the allowable variation
in the proportion of gasoline vapor to air is
restricted between very narrow limits, and
should not change more than four or five per
cent. from one extreme to the other. The
proportion of gasoline vapor to air by weight
is about one to eleven, although this will vary
somewhat with the different grades of fuels.</p>

<p>The point to be emphasized, however, is the
fact that the proper proportion of air to gasoline
vapor, however it may vary with different
grades, should be kept constant at all speeds
of the motor whenever that particular grade
of fuel is used. By volume, about 97½ per
cent. of the mixture should be air and the
remainder gasoline vapor, and it is the device
that will the most nearly maintain this proportion
under all conditions of speed, temperature,
and air pressure that will prove to be the most
delicate and flexible carburetor.</p>

<p>A carburetor may be adjusted for different
motors, or for different operating conditions of
the same motor, by means of the needle valve.
The farther end of the slim rod on which the
needle point is mounted terminates in a thread
and finger nut that projects through the shell
of the carburetor. By turning this nut in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
direction, the needle valve is screwed up toward
the cone-shaped end of the tube and the
orifice through which the gasoline may pass is
thus reduced in size. This will decrease the
amount of gasoline sprayed into the air passage
and will consequently change the composition
of the mixture. This, however, should
not be confused with throttling the motor.
When the needle valve is tightened, the
volume of the mixture passing to the cylinders
is the same, for it is only the proportion of
gasoline vapor in that mixture that is changed.</p>

<p>Throttling consists in restricting the size of
the opening through which the <em>mixture</em> passes,
and thus limits the amount of the charge that
reaches the cylinders at each suction stroke of
the piston. Throttling is used to reduce the
power&mdash;and consequently the speed&mdash;developed
by the motor, while a decrease in the
amount of gasoline supplied to the air through
the needle valve may serve to increase the
power through an improvement in the nature
of the mixture.</p>

<p>Since the gasoline vapor, by volume, forms
only about three per cent. of the explosive
mixture admitted to the cylinders, a slight
variation in the size of the needle valve opening
will result in a marked change in the composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
of the charge and may make all the
difference between poor and perfect running of
the motor. Consequently the needle valve nut
should be moved but the small fraction of a
turn for each adjustment. A motor which may
refuse absolutely to run at one position of the
needle valve may give perfect results if the
nut is unscrewed but the eighth of a turn.</p>

<p>In view of the marked difference in the results
obtained from the use of mixtures that
are "just right," and those which vary but a
slight percentage in the proportion of gasoline
vapor to air, it may be well to examine, superficially,
the effects of "rich" and "weak"
charges, and therefrom to obtain a list of
"symptoms" which may aid us to diagnose
motor trouble properly.</p>

<p>We all know that air&mdash;or oxygen&mdash;is required
to support combustion. "Snuffing" a
candle is merely covering its end so that air
cannot reach the flame. For the same reason,
gasoline in a covered tank cannot burn, no matter
how great the heat applied to it. The heat
of the electric spark in the cylinder, although
intense, does not cover a sufficiently large area
to ignite any charge except that composed of
the proper proportion of gasoline vapor and
air. If there is too much gasoline vapor, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
a "rich" mixture, there will not be sufficient
air in the charge to support the entire
combustion of the gas, and the burning will be
slow&mdash;if it takes place at all. The same conditions
will prevail if there is an insufficient
supply of air for a given quantity of gasoline
vapor, and consequently a rich mixture may be
obtained by reducing the air flow as well as by
adding to the amount of gas admitted to the
mixing chamber.</p>

<p>A rich mixture will cause irregular explosions
in the cylinders, and will often emit a
black, pungent smoke at the exhaust. The
motor will probably overheat easily, due to the
slow-burning properties of the mixture and the
resulting fact that a large portion of the cylinder
walls uncovered by the pistons will be exposed
to the flame. In some instances, the
cylinders will miss fire at regular intervals,
thus changing the synchronism of the impulses
with a well-defined and periodic "skip" in the
sound of the explosions.</p>

<p>While these are by no means certain symptoms
of a rich mixture, the first test to be made
should be to tighten the needle valve adjustment
slightly when the motor is running and to
note any resulting improvement in the regularity
of the explosions. It may sometimes be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
difficult to distinguish between the symptoms of
a rich and a weak mixture, but the readjustment
of the needle valve as just described will at
least serve to locate the trouble or to eliminate
one or the other possibility from consideration.</p>

<p>When a mixture is "starved", or when
there is an insufficient supply of gasoline vapor
to unite with the air admitted to the cylinders,
the charge will not be highly inflammable and
may not be ignited by the small spark formed
at the plug. Even when ignition does take
place, the resulting power impulse will be weak
because of the comparatively small amount of
pressure-producing gas in the mixture. The
explosions may occur regularly for a while, but
there will be a marked decrease in the power
developed by the motor, and owing to the fact
that weak mixtures may be slow-burning,
"back-firing" will often result in some engines
to which such a charge has been fed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a motor will run at all
on a weak mixture, it will produce better results
than would be the case were the charge
too rich in gasoline vapor. Consequently the
needle valve should be closed as much as is
consistent with smooth running of the motor,
but the moment a loss of power or irregular explosions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
occur, the mixture should be enriched.</p>

<p>At low speeds of the motor, the pumping action
of the pistons is not as great as is the case
at high revolutions, and consequently the suction
drawing the gasoline through the needle
valve is diminished. For this reason, the needle
valve opening must be made larger or the air
passage restricted for slow speeds of the
motor, and it was consequently necessary, on
the old, non-automatic vaporizers, to <em>increase</em>
the gasoline supply whenever the revolutions
of the motor were to be reduced. The modern
carburetor is sufficiently automatic in its action
to provide the proper mixture within wide
ranges of speed change of the motor, but even
nowadays it is often found necessary to increase
the gasoline supply or to reduce the
amount of air admitted to the intake pipe
whenever it is desired to throttle the motor
down to a very low number of revolutions per
minute.</p>

<p>The automatic action of the ordinary carburetor
is obtained by increasing the air supply
at higher speeds of the motor. Consequently
the motorist will realize that whenever
the needle valve is to be set, such regulation
should be made when the motor is well
throttled, for if an ample gasoline supply is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
obtained at low speeds, the mixture will certainly
be sufficiently rich at increased revolutions.
If, on the other hand, the carburetor
should be set to supply a proper mixture at
high speeds, the mixture would be impoverished
when the motor is throttled, and irregular
running would result.</p>

<p>The air for the operation of the motor at
ordinary speeds is supplied through a fixed
opening in the carburetor connected with the
chamber into which the gasoline spray is introduced.
In addition to this, most carburetors
are supplied with an "auxiliary air opening"
which serves to furnish the additional air necessary
for the mixture at high speeds of the
motor. The fixed opening, being restricted in
size, cannot admit the increased quantity of air
demanded by the higher speeds of the motor.
The auxiliary opening is provided with some
form of automatic valve which may consist
either of a series of ball "checks," a spring-actuated
"mushroom valve," or a series of
special valves, each of which opens at successively
increased speeds of the motor.</p>

<p>All of these devices operate on the same
principle, however, and allow the increased suction
of the motor to add to the size of the air
passage automatically&mdash;either by the farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
opening of a single valve, or by the successive
opening of different valves. Some carburetors
are provided with an adjustment by means of
which the "delicacy," or ease of opening, of
the auxiliary air valve may be regulated. This
may be done by means of a nut and screw
which will increase or decrease the tension of
the controlling spring. If this spring is set
with a high tension, the auxiliary valve will
act only when the motor is exerting great suction,
or at fast speeds.</p>

<p>The regulation of the auxiliary valve is an
adjustment that should be made only after the
needle valve has been set properly for slow
speeds of the motor. When this condition is
obtained, the throttle should be opened and
the further adjustment of the carburetor for
high speeds of the motor should then be made
through the auxiliary air valve. In other
words, the needle valve should be set so that
the motor runs properly at low speeds, while
the adjustment of the auxiliary air valve should
be made only to secure smooth operation at
a high number of revolutions.</p>

<p>It is not to be understood that less gasoline
is actually required at high speeds of the motor
because the supply often needs to be cut down
at the needle valve under these conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
The actual amount required at high speeds is,
of course, greater than is the case at slow, on
account of the greater number of explosions
in the former instance. But the suction of the
motor generally increases the gasoline flow beyond
the demands of the cylinders at high
speeds, and it is for this reason that the automatic
auxiliary air supply is provided to furnish
the additional air required to support combustion.
In fact, at heavy loads, when the total
amount of gasoline consumed must be great,
a secondary jet of fuel is brought into action
in some carburetors. This is known as the
"multiple-jet" type and is found on some of
the large engines that must possess a speed
and power variation between wide ranges. The
action of these various jets is entirely automatic
and is dependent upon the speed and fuel
requirements of the motor.</p>

<p>Were the gasoline fed directly from the fuel
tank to the needle valve of the carburetor it is
evident that the rate of flow of the liquid would
depend, to a large extent, upon the amount in
the tank and upon the position of the car. This
would cause each charge to differ in the proportion
of gasoline vapor to air, and it is
hardly probable that the motor could be run
at all under such conditions. In order that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
pistons may suck the gasoline from a level that
does not vary with the amount of fuel in the
tank or the position of the car, a separate compartment
is provided in the carburetor. This
is known as the "float chamber," and it is
from this compartment that the gasoline passes
through the needle valve into the vaporizing
or mixing chamber.</p>

<p>A cork or hollow metal float is placed in this
float chamber and is mounted on a lever connected
with a valve located at the end of the
gasoline feed pipe. As the gasoline is admitted
to the chamber, the float rises and closes
the valve controlling the flow of fuel. As the
gasoline is sucked through the needle valve
from the float chamber, the float in the latter
lowers, and the fuel is again admitted by the
opening of the above-described valve. The
float and valve are exceedingly delicate in their
operation and the gasoline is thus kept at a
constant level in the chamber under all conditions
of the car and tank.</p>

<p>The stem upon which the float of some carburetors
is mounted is sometimes threaded and
provided with a nut by means of which the
float may be raised or lowered. This furnishes
an adjustment for varying the level in the float
chamber and determining at what point the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
flow of gasoline shall be cut off by the automatic
valve. The float is supposedly properly
regulated when the carburetor leaves the factory,
but the stem may become bent or the carburetor
may be applied to a motor other than
that for which it was originally designed. In
either of these events, it may be found necessary
to raise or lower the float before the
proper level of gasoline can be maintained in
the chamber.</p>

<p>If the float is too high on its stem, the gasoline
control valve may not be operated until
the fuel overflows in its chamber. This is
known as a "flooded" carburetor and produces
a rich mixture which will ultimately prevent
the proper operation of the motor. Turning
down the gasoline supply at the needle
valve will not remedy this, for the fuel will
reach the vaporizing chamber by another
route. A flooded carburetor often gives
trouble, and while it may be remedied easily,
the amateur may experience difficulty in locating
its source.</p>

<p>As soon as it is discovered that a carburetor
has become flooded, the needle valve should
be tightened so that no gasoline can pass
through it, and the motor should then be
cranked. This will serve to evaporate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
excess gasoline in the float chamber and reduce
the level to the point at which it will not overflow.
The exact number of turns and fractions
of turns through which the needle valve nut
was moved should have been noted in order
that the valve may be reset to its original
position after the surplus fuel has been
"cranked out."</p>

<p>A float that is set too low on its stem will
close the fuel supply valve before a sufficient
amount of the fuel has flowed into the chamber,
and will form a "lean" mixture at high
speeds of the motor&mdash;even though the needle
valve should be opened wide. The obvious
remedy for such a condition is to raise the
float until the gasoline will be maintained at
the proper level. If there is no nut and screw
adjustment by which the float may be raised,
the arm to which it is attached, and which is
connected with the valve, may be bent slightly.</p>

<p>But the motorist should not "jump at conclusions"
and assume that the float is improperly
set the moment the carburetor begins to
flood or the motor appears to "starve" at high
speed. The first condition may be caused by
a piece of dirt or other foreign matter that
may have become lodged on the valve seat
and prevented the valve from closing when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
gasoline reached the proper level in the float
chamber. This will produce exactly the same
results as will a high float and is a trouble
that will more often occur in the average
carburetor.</p>

<p>The difficulty may generally be remedied
easily by draining the gasoline from the
float chamber after the valve in the main
supply pipe has been turned off. The offending
foreign matter will generally be carried
with the gasoline as the latter is drained,
and the valve in the feed pipe may again be
opened as soon as the drain cock is shut off.
If this fails to remedy matters, it is probable
that the difficulty lies with the float.</p>

<p>A clogged gasoline pipe or dirty strainer
will produce the same effect on the operation of
the motor as will a float that is set too low on
its stem. When the motor seems to starve at
high speed, and it is evident that there is sufficient
gasoline in the tank, the union should be
disconnected at the point where the feed pipe
joins the carburetor. If there appears to be
an ample flow through this pipe when the main
valve is opened, it is probable that the stoppage
has occurred in the strainer. If the flow
through the main feed pipe is not free, however,
it is possible that the vent hole in the filler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
cap on the tank has become stopped or that the
latter has been screwed down too tightly. In
the gravity feed systems, some method must be
provided to allow the air to flow into the tank
to replace the gasoline fed to the carburetor.
If there is no hole in the filler cap, the latter
should not be screwed down so tightly that an
airtight joint will be formed.</p>

<p>Probably the simplest method of determining
whether the trouble lies in a low float is
to prime the carburetor and to observe the
ease with which this can be done and its effect
upon the engine. Nearly every carburetor
is provided with a "flushing" or "priming"
pin by means of which the float can be depressed
so that the gasoline chamber will be
filled rapidly to a point above its normal level.
This is useful in starting, as the desired rich
mixture is quickly obtained without an undue
amount of cranking. If the carburetor flushes
easily, it is evident that there is no serious
stoppage in the pipe. If this easy flushing is
followed by good running on the part of the
motor, and if this, in turn, is succeeded by
gradually-diminishing impulses indicating a
weakening mixture, it is quite evident that the
float is preventing the flow of the gasoline at
the proper time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>In addition to the flush pin found on carburetors,
many are provided with other devices
to render starting easy. It is well known
that a "high-test" gasoline, such as a 76, will
vaporize more easily than will one of a lower
degree of specific gravity. Also, every motorist
has had impressed upon him the fact
that heat aids in the vaporization of gasoline.
If we try to start a motor on a cold morning
with a low-grade gasoline, such as the 60- or
62-degree fuel now generally obtained, we
know that a rag dipped in hot water and wound
around the carburetor will help matters.</p>

<p>To enable low grades of fuel to be properly
vaporized under all running conditions, many
carburetors are provided with a water jacket
surrounding the vaporizing chamber. This
jacket is connected with the cooling system of
the motor, and the hot water surrounding the
chamber so warms the interior that vaporization
is greatly facilitated. Some of these systems
are provided with a shut-off cock by
means of which the carburetor may be operated
with hot water in the jackets, or not, as
desired.</p>

<p>Other carburetors employ a jacket surrounding
the exhaust pipe of the motor and connected
with the vaporizing chamber. The air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
is heated by the hot exhaust pipe as it is sucked
into the carburetor, and this also facilitates
the vaporization of the fuel. Some carburetors
are provided with both jacket systems,
while others have neither, but whatever
design is installed, the best results will be obtained
if cold air is used after the motor is
once started. Cold air is more "concentrated"
and contains a greater amount of
oxygen per cubic foot than does air that has
been expanded by heat, and consequently many
carburetors are provided with a means of turning
off the hot air after the motor is started.</p>

<p>The higher the degree of specific gravity of
a fuel on the Baumè scale, the more volatile
will it be, and consequently a 68° gasoline will
vaporize more easily and give more power
than will a 60° or 62° fuel. 72° gasoline is
often used in races, but the average motorist
does not get better than 64°&mdash;and he is sometimes
lucky to obtain fuel of that specific
gravity. A hydrometer, or specific gravity
tester, is a convenient instrument for the average
motorist to own, and with it he may tell
exactly what grade of fuel he is paying for.
The Baumè scale, by which all gasoline is
tested, reads in degrees, and the specific gravity
is obtained by observing the depth to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
hydrometer sinks in the liquid. This instrument
resembles somewhat a glass thermometer,
and is so graduated that the deeper it sinks in
a liquid, the higher will be the reading on its
scale.</p>

<p>Water in the fuel is an annoyance that is
often encountered by the automobilist and the
motor boatman, and this will make its presence
known by causing the motor to skip when
all adjustments and connections seem to be in
perfect condition. Water is much heavier
than gasoline and has no affinity for it, and
consequently, as it sinks to the bottom of the
tank, a few drops in a large amount of gasoline
will cause trouble by passing out through the
needle valve at intermittent intervals and forming
an unexplosive mixture.</p>

<p>The presence of the water in the fuel may
be detected easily without the use of a hydrometer
by drawing some gasoline from the bottom
of the tank into a tin or white-enameled
cup. If water is present, it may be seen in the
form of small globules in the bottom of the
cup. If the contents of the cup are poured
over a flat surface so that the liquid may be
allowed to spread, the gasoline will be seen to
cover a large surface and evaporate quickly,
while the water will seem to remain in the globules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
unevaporated for some time after the
gasoline has disappeared. This latter test will
sometimes show the presence of water when
none can be discerned in the bottom of the cup
before the contents are poured out on the flat
surface.</p>

<p>The practice of "doping" the fuel tank by
adding to the gasoline ether or some other
highly volatile liquid is not to be recommended
to the average motorist. A few ounces of
ether or chloroform added to the fuel will
form a more volatile and consequently more
powerful mixture, but unless the greatest care
is taken, the motor is liable to be completely
ruined by such a procedure. Numerous cases
are on record in which cylinder heads have
been blown off or castings cracked by the force
of some of the explosions when too much
"dope" has found its way into the mixture.</p>

<p>Although the average motor gasoline obtainable
nowadays is hardly all that could be
desired as automobile fuel, a little care taken
when filling the tank will eliminate many of the
carburetor annoyances to which many cars
seem to be subject. The cap of the tank should
never be taken off when the air is filled with
particles of dust that are liable to find their
way into the fuel, and care should be taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
see that no pieces of the rubber or leather
washer or packing drop into the gasoline when
the cap is removed. Foreign matter and water
that may be in the gasoline when purchased
may be removed by straining the fuel through
a chamois skin placed inside of the funnel
through which the tank is filled.</p>

<span class="smcap small">Lubrication</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">A lubricant</span> acts as a sort of pacifier
between two surfaces that would otherwise
move in contact with each other.
No surface can move in direct contact with
another of the same or a different material
without the generation of heat; but the amount
of heat generated, or resistance met with, is
determined by the nature of these two rubbing
surfaces. The oil, or grease, or whatever
suave, slippery substance is to be used as a
lubricant, interposes itself in a thin film between
the two rubbing surfaces and smooths
matters over, as it were. If a sufficient amount
of this mechanical soothing syrup is not fed
to the rubbing surfaces, the temper and
temperature of each will be raised to the point
where they will "clinch," and much time and
effort may be required before harmony can
again be restored.</p>

<p>Thus it is actually upon a film of lubricant
that a shaft rests, rather than upon the bearing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
or "box," in which it turns. If the bearing
is set so tight that there is no room for the
interposition of an oil film, the shaft and
journal will at once heat. The greater the
pressure of the shaft in its box, the thicker, or
heavier, should be the lubricant used, for a
light oil would be squeezed out or "broken
down" more easily than would one that possesses
greater viscosity.</p>

<p>The "coefficient of friction" may be termed
the mechanical "amount of irritability" generated
when two surfaces are rubbed together.
Thus if two metals are rubbed together, this
figure is high, and a large amount of friction,
or heat, will be generated. A metal rubbing
over oil, however&mdash;as is the case with a well-lubricated
bearing&mdash;will arouse but little resentment
and its pathway will be made smooth
and easy, for the coefficient of friction of these
two materials is low. The lower this figure
can be kept, the more easily can the surfaces
be rubbed over each other and the higher will
be the efficiency of the bearing.</p>

<p>Apply this to every bearing or rubbing surface
of a motor, and we see that proper lubrication
affects not only the length of life of the
moving parts, but the ease with which the engine
can be run and the consequent power development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Thus, a lubricant that will prevent
wear between the moving parts may be
supplied to the bearings and pistons of a motor,
and under this condition the engine might
"last" indefinitely; but this oil might be so
viscous or possess so high a coefficient of friction
that each bearing would turn with difficulty
and much effort would be required to run
the motor before it could begin to develop
power.</p>

<p>But the introduction of oil to a bearing not
only reduces the friction between the surfaces
that would otherwise move in contact with
each other, but it serves another very important
purpose. Every properly-lubricated portion
of a motor either moves in a bath of oil
or is connected with an oil reservoir so that
a certain amount will be fed regularly to the
rubbing surfaces. There is always <em>some</em> heat
generated in a bearing, no matter how well it
may be lubricated, and the continuous flow or
circulation of the oil serves to carry off this
heat that would otherwise tend to dry the lubricant
if there were no fresh supply.</p>

<p>The proper lubrication of the motor is even
more necessary than is the adjustment of the
carburetor or the condition of the ignition system.
To be sure, if either the carburetor or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the ignition system is out of order, the motor
will not run, but no actual harm to the mechanism
will result from this fact. On the
other hand, a motor may be run indefinitely
with a defective lubricating system, and no
apparent harm will result&mdash;until the end of
that indefinite time arrives and it is found
that the machine is a fit subject for a junk heap.</p>

<p>Let us see how many parts of the motor are
reached by the gallon or so of oil that we pour
into the tank. A six-cylinder motor may have
seven crank shaft bearings; it will certainly
possess six connecting rods, each of
which will be provided with a bearing at both
its large and small ends&mdash;or twelve in all;
there may be two cam shafts, each with five
bearings and half a dozen cams; these will
require, together with the magneto and pump
shafts, five or six gears in the forward train;
and the six pistons will demand their share of
attention from the lubricating system. Here is
a grand total of over fifty rubbing surfaces
on a large motor, and the oil must be
thoroughly and constantly distributed to each.
Of course, many smaller motors, provided with
but a single cam shaft and a three-bearing
crank shaft, may possess but one-half of this
number of lubricated parts, but at the least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the oil must reach with unfailing certainty two
dozen vital places of the engine.</p>

<p>At some of these portions, the movement is
comparatively slow and the pressure is not
great. Therefore such surfaces as the cams or
valve stem rollers will demand less oil than
will the bearings revolving at higher speed and
carrying heavier loads. But it is the hardest-worked
bearings that form the majority of the
friction surfaces of a motor, as will be realized
when it is remembered that all points on the
circumference of a three-inch crank shaft bearing
will travel at the approximate rate of 1,000
feet per minute&mdash;and these are the portions
that also carry the heaviest load.</p>

<p>But while the pistons can hardly be called
bearings in the generally-accepted layman's definition
of the term, they require the lion's
share of the lubricant, and are the first portions
of the motor to feel&mdash;and show&mdash;the effect
of any failure of the oiling system. While
in terms of miles per hour, the movement of
the pistons may not seem very rapid, the
thousand feet per minute at which each
ordinarily travels is rather a high rate of speed
when it is considered that it is entirely a rubbing
or a sliding motion, and that the direction
is reversed more than two thousand times during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
each sixty-second period. This means that
each piston slides or rubs within the cylinder
walls for a distance of between two and three
thousand miles during an ordinary season.
And remember that this is not a rolling motion,
but a continuous rubbing! In addition to this
high-speed rubbing, the pistons are pressed
firmly against the side of the cylinders on each
explosion stroke throughout a portion of their
travel. This corresponds to a heavy pressure
carried by the rubbing surfaces, and is caused
by the side thrust induced by the angularity of
the connecting rod as it overcomes the resistance
of the load through the crank shaft.</p>

<p>But this is only a small portion of the difficulties
that must be overcome in cylinder lubrication.
Not only must the oil pacify the rubbing
surfaces and keep them well separated,
but it must remain within a restricted territory
of the cylinder walls. Whatever oil reaches
the upper portion of the cylinder walls will be
burned and will contribute to the formation of
the carbon that is the mortal enemy of efficient
running. Large quantities of oil burned
in the cylinder will also form the dense clouds
of choking blue smoke that the health authorities
of many cities have been investigating,
which have led to the enactment of city ordinances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
making the driving of a smoking automobile
a misdemeanor.</p>

<p>In view of the difficulty which has been experienced
by many drivers in sufficiently lubricating
the pistons without causing the car to
emit clouds of smoke, it may well be asked,
"Why cannot an unburnable oil be used and
thereby eliminate this trouble?" This is out
of the question, for the mineral oils now used
are obtained from petroleum and are cousins
of kerosene, gasoline, benzine, and many of
the other highly-inflammable liquids that need
but the touch of a match to burn almost with
the rapidity of an explosion. But notwithstanding
the excitable family to which the
mineral oils belong, the modern motor car
lubricants are removed a sufficient distance
from their more inflammable relatives to enable
them to withstand a temperature of between
400 and 500 degrees, Fahrenheit. This
is sufficient heat-resisting ability to enable the
oil to stay on the cylinder walls near the bottom
of the stroke, where it is most needed;
but even though its burning point could be
raised to a degree double its present amount,
it could not withstand the high temperature
generated in the top of the cylinder at the time
of the explosion. The temperature here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
reaches a point well above the 2000-degree
mark, and were it not for the cooling system,
parts of the interior of the cylinder would
probably be melted by the continued application
of this excessive heat.</p>

<p><em>Any</em> oil, consequently, would find but small
opportunity to remain in its normal state after
it once reached a point at which it would be
exposed to the heat of the explosions, and we
must look for a preventive measure other than
that of increasing the flash-point or burning-point
of the lubricant. But this high temperature
does not exist throughout the stroke,
for as the piston descends and the gas expands,
heat is given off until the oil on the
lower portions of the cylinder uncovered by
the piston is sometimes able to remain in comparative
peace. And even though this oil remaining
on the cylinder walls at the bottom of
the stroke should be burned, it would not be
present in sufficient volume to create the dense
clouds of objectionable smoke. Consequently
it is the endeavor of engineers so to design the
pistons and lubricating system that excess oil
will not be fed to the pistons and allowed to
remain on the walls after the former have
descended.</p>

<p>But an excess amount of oil fed to the cylinders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
will result in so much less harm than will
an insufficient supply, that we are treading on
rather dangerous ground when we warn the
amateur to cut down his lubricant to the point
where there will be no smoke. As there are
no ordinances that absolutely prohibit the
slightest appearance of smoke at the exhaust,
and as a faint blue trail is an excellent indication
that the motor is receiving sufficient lubrication
in the cylinders, it forms a satisfactory
test by which the novice can determine
the condition of the oiling system.</p>

<p>By the time that the exhaust gases have
passed through the pipes and have expanded
in the muffler, some of the blue smoke may
have disappeared, and consequently the fact
that a car does not give a trace of vapor at its
exhaust should not necessarily be taken as an
indication that the motor is not well lubricated.
If the owner would satisfy himself that the
cylinders are receiving a sufficient amount of
oil, he may open the individual pet cock on
each, and if he finds there a faint blue trail of
smoke at each explosion in that cylinder, he
may rest assured that harmony exists between
the rubbing surfaces of the piston and the
cylinder walls.</p>

<p>With the increase in the size and power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
the automobile motors and the proportionately
greater number of parts demanding lubrication,
the attention required from the driver by
the oiling system has been greatly lessened.
Instead of the necessity of turning on individual
oil cups whenever the motor is started,
the modern driver merely twirls the starting
crank or presses the button of the self-starter,
secure in the knowledge that whenever the motor
runs, the lubricating system operates&mdash;provided,
of course, the reservoir is filled and
there is no stoppage in the pipes. The oiling
system of the modern motor is absolutely automatic,
and if supplied with a sufficient quantity
of a good lubricant, it will perform its work
with an absence of trouble that places it among
the greatest improvements of the engine of recent
years.</p>

<p>Individual oil cups such as were used formerly,
have been eliminated from the cylinders,
and whatever sight-feeds there may be are
placed on the dash in plain view of the driver.
Instead of relying upon the suction of the
cylinders for the positive feed to the piston,
mechanically-operated pumps are used to force
the oil to the various portions of the motor.
In some systems, there is a separate pump for
each oil lead. This is known as a mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
oiler, and generally consists of an oil tank located
on the dashboard of the car&mdash;either in
front of the driver, or under the motor hood&mdash;and
connected by means of a belt or gear
with some shaft of the motor. The belt or
gear drives a shaft to which is connected the
plungers of the various oil pumps that force
the oil to the different parts of the motor. Before
passing to the individual pipe, however,
the oil drops through a sight-feed connected
with that lead, and as all of these sight-feeds
are mounted in a row within plain view of the
driver, the condition of the lubricating system
in part or in whole may be determined at a
glance.</p>

<p>The parts of the motor that are lubricated
by an independent feed line in this manner may
vary with different motors. In general, however,
it may be said that it is seldom that the
oil is fed directly to the piston, but that the lubricant
is first distributed to the oil wells in the
crank case. Here, the splash of the cranks as
they revolve in the oil is depended upon to
throw the lubricant upon the exposed portion
of the piston as it reciprocates below the cylinder
walls. The sides of the piston thus
covered carry the oil to the cylinder walls.</p>

<p>It is evident that if an excess amount of oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
is continually carried up by the piston to the
cylinder walls, a certain proportion of this lubricant
will reach the open space in which the
charge is ignited, and will there be burned&mdash;with
the attendant formation of clouds of objectionable
smoke. This trouble is overcome
to a certain extent in some motors by the use
of a type of ring set in the piston that prevents
the lubricant from passing to the upper portion
of the cylinder; but all the oil cannot thus be
retained, and it therefore behooves the driver
not to allow too great a quantity to be fed
to the crank case if the "splash" system is
used.</p>

<p>The main bearings on which the crank shaft
revolves are generally supplied with oil by independent
leads from the oiler, and when the
above-described system is used they may be
regulated independently of the splash feed lubricating
pipes. Excess oil at the bearings will
cause no damage, but each crank shaft journal
does not demand as great an amount as that
supplied to a piston and connecting rod bearing.</p>

<p>Many lubricating systems that are now in
popular use employ but one pump to force the
oil to the various bearings and rubbing surfaces,
and regulate the supply by the size of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
pipe leading to each. A satisfactory method
of overcoming the possibility of excess oil in
the cylinder has been adopted by some manufacturers.
This consists in placing a channel,
or trough, directly under the lower sweep of
each connecting rod bearing. Each channel is
kept filled to overflowing by a separate pipe
connected with the main lead from the pump,
and a constant level is consequently maintained
at all speeds of the motor. An elaboration of
this method consists in attaching one end of
each trough to a rod operated in conjunction
with the throttle, so that as the speed of the
motor increases, the end of the channels may
be tilted, with the result that the connecting
rod scoop will dip deeper into the lubricant.</p>

<p>After the proper level in each trough has
been reached the excess oil overflows into the
bottom of the crank case. From here, it is
again started on its way by the pump and is
distributed to the various bearings and troughs
through the different pipes leading from the
pump. As a further precaution against a
smoking exhaust, some designers have added a
baffle plate above each crank case compartment
that serves to reduce the size of the opening
through which the oil may be splashed.
With this combination of troughs and baffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
plates the possibility of a smoking motor is
practically eliminated.</p>

<p>All motors are not so equipped, however,
and in the case of those provided with the
bona-fide splash system, care must be taken to
keep the separate crank case compartments
filled to the proper level. Too high a level in
the crank cases will cause the motor to smoke;
while the supply should not be allowed to become
so low that when the angle of the crank
case is changed&mdash;as in ascending a hill&mdash;the
lubricant will run toward the rear and will not
be reached by the scoop on the connecting rod
bearing. This latter danger makes it advisable
to give this system plenty of oil when any touring
is to be done through a hilly district.</p>

<p>In some lubricating systems, the oil is supplied
as it is used, and either is discharged with
the exhaust, or collects in the bottom of the
crank case, from which it should be drained
occasionally. In the circulating systems, however,
which are now used on a majority of the
cars, the same oil is used continuously until it
becomes "worn" or filled with sediment and
particles of dirt and other foreign matter.
The pump used for maintaining this circulation
may be either of the plunger, centrifugal, or
gear type, and is generally housed in a portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of the crank case. A strainer is usually placed
in the suction end of this pump for the purpose
of removing all the free foreign matter from
the oil before it is again started on its mission
of lubrication. In these systems, the oil well
is generally located in a "secondary" bottom
of the crank case. From here it may be
drained when the supply is to be renewed.</p>

<p>Another successful system by which all the
bearings of the crank shaft are positively lubricated
is used on many of the best cars. In
this system, a continuous oil hole passes
throughout the length of the crank shaft, including
its "arms" and connecting rod bearings.
At each bearing, one or two small oil
holes connect with this main artery and extend
radially to the surface. Oil is forced into the
longitudinal oil hole by means of a small pump,
and naturally finds its way through every radial
opening to all the bearings. The excess may
overflow into the individual oil wells, from
which it will be splashed upon the exposed portions
of the pistons as they descend.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, no matter what modern
oiling system is used, the same kind of lubricant
is supplied to all parts of the motor.
This feature makes matters much simpler than
was the case when one oil was used for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
cylinders, another, of a different thickness,
supplied to the crank case, and still a third
required for the gears. By the old gravity systems,
the flow of oil depended largely upon its
viscosity, or thickness. Therefore, in winter,
a thinner oil was required than in summer, for
the more a lubricant is warmed, the thinner
does it become&mdash;and vice versa. With the
mechanical force systems now in use, however,
practically the same kind of oil may be used
throughout the year&mdash;although many motorists
believe that better results will be obtained
if a heavier oil is used in summer than in
winter. The oil will be warmed by the motor
and it will not require many minutes of operation
before a lubricant made thick by a low
temperature will flow freely and do its work as
efficiently as a thinner oil.</p>

<p>But no matter how reliable a lubricating system
may be in its operation, the driver must do
his share and make certain that fresh oil of the
proper quality is supplied when needed, and
assure himself that all the passages are free
from obstructions. Negligence on the driver's
part may result in one or more "stuck" pistons
that will either seriously injure the motor,
or will put it out of commission until the
trouble can be remedied. If a sufficient supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
of oil is not fed to the rubbing surfaces between
the piston and the cylinder walls, a high degree
of heat is generated which will tend to expand
the piston until it grips the cylinder so closely
that the former cannot be moved. In this
event the motor will stop "dead," and cannot
be started again until the piston has cooled
and contracted to its normal size. Even then,
however, the motor should not be run under
its own power until the burned and gummed oil
has been removed and the scored surfaces have
been cleaned. While this may best be done by
removing the piston&mdash;at which time an examination
for any badly burned rings may be
made&mdash;this is not always possible, and it may
be necessary to run the car home or to the nearest
repair shop before the proper repairs can
be made.</p>

<p>In this case, the motor should be turned by
hand until it is certain that the piston is again
free in its cylinder. Liberal quantities of kerosene
oil should be poured in through the spark
plug opening, and if possible, the motor should
be "rocked" back and forth by the flywheel to
give the kerosene an opportunity to reach all
parts of the piston and rings. The kerosene
will serve to cut and remove much of the carbon
and gummed oil and to make the way free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
for the fresh lubricant, which should be poured
in liberal quantities into the cylinder head.
The flywheel should again be moved back and
forth so that the oil will reach all parts of the
piston surface, and after this&mdash;if the damage
has not been too great&mdash;the motor should be
ready for operation.</p>

<span class="smcap small">Cooling</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">To</span> enable the parts of a motor to work
well, there must be freedom of motion
between all that move in contact with
each other. This necessary freedom of motion
is provided for to a certain extent by proper
lubrication, but this is not all-sufficient. The
necessity for some additional friction- and
heat-reducing system can be better realized
when it is understood that the temperature of
the explosion in the cylinders of a gasoline engine
is well over 2,600 degrees, Fahrenheit.
The melting point of pure iron is less than
2,800 degrees. Therefore were there no
escape for this heat, and could the motor be
induced to run under these severe conditions,
the cylinders would soon reach a temperature
dangerously near the melting point. Long before
this point could be reached, however, the
intense heat would have expanded the pistons
so that they would become stuck in their cylinders,
and no more explosions could occur. An<span class="page"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
ominous knock in one or more of the cylinders,
followed by a sudden laboring and final cessation
of operation on the part of the motor, is
sometimes the first intimation that the driver
may have that his engine is over-heated; but
serious as a "stuck" piston may seem, it is
fortunate that the motor stops of its own accord,
for to continue to run under these conditions
of constantly increasing heat would be
to wreak far more serious and permanent
damage upon the moving parts than the broken
rings or scored cylinders that usually result
from a lack of lubrication or cooling medium.</p>

<p>A large amount of the heat resulting from
each explosion is carried out through the exhaust
pipe in the form of the burned gases,
while other portions radiate into the surrounding
air. These outlets are not sufficient, however,
to carry away all the heat that is necessary
to enable the motor to run efficiently, for
proper piston lubrication is exceedingly difficult
to obtain at high temperatures. There
must, therefore, be more positive and direct
means for carrying off this undesired heat, and
to accomplish this result every internal combustion
motor is provided with a cooling system
of either the air or liquid (usually water)
type. Motorcycle power plants and a few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the small and medium-sized automobile engines
employ the air-cooling system; the great
majority of automobile engines, stationary
plants, and marine motors use water as the
cooling medium.</p>

<p>Let us consider first the air-cooled system.
The area presented by the outside of a smooth
cylinder is not large enough to enable sufficient
radiation to take place. That is, the heat
is concentrated on a comparatively small surface,
and this is much more difficult to keep
cool than is the same amount of heat distributed
over a greater area&mdash;for the cylinder
will be exposed to a larger quantity of fresh
air in the latter case. Therefore many air-cooled
engines are provided with a series of
grooves and flanges on the outer surface of the
cylinder. The heat is conducted to all parts
of this surface&mdash;flanges as well as grooves&mdash;and
the area of the surface that is exposed to
the cooling air is greatly increased thereby.</p>

<p>These grooves and flanges may extend circumferentially
around the cylinder, as is the
case with many motorcycle engines, or they
may extend longitudinally. Another form of
air-cooling system consists of pins or spines
projecting radially from the surface of the
cylinder. The motion of the car through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
air is generally sufficient to create a circulation
of the cooling medium, but in order that this
circulation may continue while the car is at
rest a high-speed fan is provided that draws
the air from the front toward the rear of the
motor. This serves also to supplement the air
circulation produced by the motion of the car,
and keeps the motor much cooler than would
be the case were the machine run without the
fan. This fan is generally attached to a
bracket at the front of the motor, and is driven
either by a belt or geared shaft. In some
designs, however, the fan blades are included
in the flywheel at the rear of the motor and
the air is thus sucked over the cylinders.</p>

<p>One of the most effective air-cooling systems
for use on an automobile motor consists
of the above-mentioned longitudinal flanges
and grooves enclosed in a thin jacket or casing
surrounding each cylinder. These jackets are
open at the top and bottom of the cylinders,
and connect with large pipes, or troughs,
through which air is forced. The trough into
which the top of the jacket spaces open is connected
with the discharge end of a large fan.
The air is thus driven into the top trough,
through each jacket, and into the lower
trough, the farther termination of which is connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
with the suction end of a fan included in
the flywheel. The two fans serve to set up a
rapid circulation of air which, by means of the
troughs and jackets, is concentrated upon the
surfaces of the grooves and flanges of each
cylinder and none is wasted on parts of the motor
that it is unnecessary to cool. Furthermore,
the rear cylinders receive as much air as do the
forward ones, for the trough serves to distribute
the circulation equally along the grooves
and flanges of each.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the heat from an air-cooled motor
is radiated directly into the current of air
itself, the surface is very susceptible to temperature
changes from the interior. Thus, if
the car is run for a great distance on the low
gear, and the cylinders become hot in consequence,
a larger amount of heat will immediately
be radiated from the cooling surfaces
than is the case when the motor is running
slowly. A "coast" down a short hill,
however, will serve to cool the motor rapidly,
for if the engine is run from the momentum
of the car with the spark turned off, cool air
will be drawn into the cylinders, and this, in
addition to the circulation of cold air on the
outside, will reduce the temperature of the engine
rapidly. This is a feature of the operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
of an air-cooled motor that is not possessed
to so large an extent by those of the
water-cooled type.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, hardly accurate to apply the
term "water-cooled" to the ordinary type of
automobile motor. Water is merely the
medium that transfers the heat from the cylinders
to the cooling surface of the radiator.
As air is used to cool this heated water, we see
that the only difference between the two systems
lies in the point of application of the
actual heat-absorbing medium&mdash;which is air in
both cases. Thus in the air-cooled motor the
air is carried directly to the surfaces to be
cooled; while in the other type, the heat is
transferred by means of the water to the point
where it may be effectually discharged into the
air.</p>

<p>Each cylinder of a water-cooled motor is
surrounded by a space known as the water
jacket. This space is generally cast with the
cylinder, although in some designs of motors
the jackets are formed by the subsequent application
of a copper casing that serves to retain
the water. The water jackets are connected
with each other by means of piping and
water-tight joints so that the water will pass
successively from one to the other. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
water remained in these spaces, it would soon
be warmed to a temperature far above the boiling
point, steam would be formed, a high pressure
generated, and infinite harm would result&mdash;both
to motor and to passengers. The piping,
however, does not end with the connections
between the cylinders, but extends to and
from the radiator.</p>

<p>This radiator is a large, perforated structure
placed either forward of the motor to form the
end of the bonnet-covering, or in front of the
dash between it and the rear cylinder of the
engine. The radiator is a mass of small cellular
or tubular passages, each one of which possesses
an exceedingly large outer surface in
proportion to the amount of water that it can
contain. When the hot water reaches the
radiator it is distributed to these many cells or
tubes, and is thus spread over a large cooling
surface. A large fan is usually located directly
behind the radiator, and as this serves to
draw the air rapidly through the openings between
the cells or tubes, cooling is greatly
facilitated.</p>

<p>There are several types of radiators in general
use. Some consist of a number of flat cells
placed in such a manner that regular-shaped
air openings will be formed. Each side of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
flat water cell abuts on an air passage. Such
a radiator is known as the honeycomb, or cellular,
the former term being applied to those
whose cells resemble a honeycomb. The tubular
radiator consists of a number of vertical, parallel
tubes through which the water passes, and
which are placed a sufficient distance apart to
provide ample air passages between them.
Each tube is covered at frequent intervals with
fluted, circular flanges that serve to increase
the radiating surface in much the same manner
as do the grooves and flanges on the cylinders
of the air-cooled motor. All air passages
in any radiator extend directly through the
width of the radiator, while the water circulates
from top to bottom in a vertical direction.</p>

<p>The reason for this circulation of the water
will be apparent if we call to mind a bit of our
elementary physics. When water is heated, it
expands and rises, and for this reason, we always
find the surface of the water in a teakettle
warmer than is that at the bottom&mdash;although
the latter is closer to the fire. As the
water is circulated through the radiator, it is
cooled by the passage of the large amount of
air through the openings between the cells or
tubes. The water thus cooled sinks to the bottom
of the radiator and is replaced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
water just heated by the motor. The cooled
water is conducted to the bottom portion of
the end cylinder, and passes to the others in
succession, gradually rising as it is heated, until
it is again forced to the radiator at the top.</p>

<p>There are two methods of circulating the
water through the cylinder jackets and radiator.
The most common method consists of
the introduction of a pump in the lower portion
of the circulating system. In the case of
automobile motors, this pump is driven by
gears connected with the crank shaft of the engine.
Such a pump will be either of the gear
or centrifugal type, and will suck the cooled
water from the lower portion of the radiator,
and force it through the jackets. The second
method is known as the thermo-syphon system
because the circulation is automatic and depends
upon the cooling of the water in the radiator.
When the cooled water sinks, a syphon
action is formed that tends to draw the hot
water from the cylinder jackets, and the automatic
circulation will thus continue as long as
the successive heating and cooling take place.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the pump is driven by the crank
shaft of the engine, its speed will be proportional
to that of the motor. The same
holds true of the fan that serves to draw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
air through the radiator. It will thus be seen
that both the water and the air are forced at a
more rapid rate when the motor runs at high
speed, and that therefore the extra heat generated
by the more frequent explosions in the
cylinders will be counteracted to a certain extent.
The increased number of explosions and
the higher speed at which the fan turns also
cause quicker heating and cooling of the water
by the thermo-syphon system, thus forming a
more rapid circulation. Inasmuch as the force
exerted upon the water by its cooling and heating
is not as great as that formed by a high-speed
and efficient pump, the pipes and connections
of the thermo-syphon system must be of
ample size in order to keep the resistance to
the passage of the water as low as possible.
Care must also be taken in the design of this
system so to construct and connect the pipes
and jackets that the hot water will be allowed
to rise and the cool to descend, and thus to
make possible the syphon conditions on which
principle the circulation is based.</p>

<p>The ability of the radiator to carry off the
heat from the water depends upon the rapidity
with which the air passes through the passages
provided for the purpose. The amount of air
passing through is determined by the speed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the suction fan and the rapidity of travel of
the car itself against the wind. It has been
shown that, when the motor runs at a high
number of revolutions, the fan turns faster
and the rapidity of circulation is increased.
But if the car itself does not increase its speed
in proportion to the higher revolutions of the
motor, the maximum amount of air will not be
forced through the radiator passages, and the
excess heat will not be carried off entirely from
the cylinders. This is a condition that prevails
when the motor is run on low gear. The speed
of the motor is increased, while that of the car
is reduced; additional heat is generated in the
cylinders, but the speed of the air is not increased
in proportion. Therefore a motor
that is driven a long distance on the low gear
will have a tendency to overheat.</p>

<p>Water under atmospheric pressure cannot
be brought to a temperature above 212 degrees
Fahrenheit without being converted into
steam. Therefore, when the heat from a
water-cooled motor cannot be carried away
sufficiently fast, the water in the circulating
system will begin to boil. As long as water remains
in the jackets, the temperature of these
spaces cannot well rise above 212 degrees, and
consequently there is small danger that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
water-cooled motor will become overheated to
the point at which the pistons will "seize" in
the cylinders. The moment the water in the
circulating system begins to boil, however, exceedingly
rapid evaporation naturally takes
place, and the water will soon entirely disappear
in the form of steam and vapor. To run
the motor under these conditions will mean that
pistons and rings will soon become stuck in
their cylinders, although liberal quantities of
oil will sometimes delay this inevitable result.</p>

<p>But even when the cooling water is not
brought to the boiling point there is a vapor
that is constantly dispelled from it whenever its
temperature is brought above that of the air.
The water system of an automobile must therefore
be replenished at irregular intervals, depending
upon the amount and nature of the
running to which the car has been subjected.
The older cars were provided with an extra
water tank, generally located under the seat,
and connected directly with the water jackets
and the radiator. The usual water-cooling
system of the present-day car, however, is self-contained&mdash;that
is, there is no separate tank
for the storage of the water. The water is
poured into the top of the radiator, and from
this high point it reaches every part of the circulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
system. Whenever the radiator will
accommodate a couple of quarts, or more, it is
well to fill it, for <em>too much</em> water <em>cannot be used</em>
on the modern design of cooling system. It is
true that a motor runs at its highest efficiency
when its temperature is as great as that at
which proper lubrication of the pistons can be
obtained&mdash;for a gasoline engine is a "heat engine,"
and the greater its unnecessary heat
losses, the less will be the power developed by
it. But a motor cannot be kept at the proper
temperature by reducing the amount of cooling
water in its circulating system. The best
method is to lessen the rapidity with which the
water is cooled, and this may be accomplished
by placing a leather flap, a cardboard, or other
obstruction over a portion of the radiator to
reduce the number of openings through which
the air may pass. It should only be necessary
to do this in the coldest weather, however, for
the cooling system of every motor is designed
to maintain the proper temperature on all except
the hottest or coldest days.</p>

<p>It has been stated in a preceding paragraph
that continued running on the low gear is the
most frequent cause of overheating a motor.
This is true, but it is not the only cause. Obstructions
in the circulating system that reduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
the flow of water will have this effect, as will
also deposits on the interior of the cylinders
that serve to prevent the proper transfer of
heat to the water in the jacket spaces. Removal
of the carbon will remedy the latter
trouble, but to clear out the circulating system
is more or less of a complicated matter.
Stoppage in the pipes or radiator cells may be
caused by a lime deposit from "hard" water
that may have been used in the circulating system.
There are preparations intended to remove
this deposit, but such should not be used
without first advising with the maker of the car
or an experienced repair man. A series of battered
cells in the radiator may reduce the number
of cooling spaces that should be traversed
by the water, and thus the hot water cannot be
distributed over as great an air area as is necessary
to maintain the motor at the proper
temperature. Such a condition will be apparent
from a marked difference in temperature between
the affected portion of the radiator and
the remainder. If a deposit has been formed
on a certain series of cells, or if they have been
obstructed in any other manner, the hot water
cannot circulate through this section of the radiator,
and it will remain comparatively cool.</p>

<p>Water is a liquid that remains in its fluid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
stage only through a temperature range of 180
degrees&mdash;at atmospheric pressure. At 212 degrees
it boils and turns to vapor, while at 32
degrees it freezes and becomes a solid. In
neither of these stages does it form a desirable
cooling medium for a gasoline motor. Of the
two, however, its solid stage is the more harmful
to the motor. Not only will it cease to flow
when it becomes ice, but the expansion of the
water during the formation of the solid is
liable to burst its retainer&mdash;whether it be the
cells of the radiator, the pump, pipes, or even
the cylinder walls themselves. It is the radiator
that is the most liable to suffer from
such a cause, however, for each cell contains so
small an amount of water that the liquid will
be brought to the freezing point before the
larger volume in the jacket spaces approaches
this temperature. Of course the water will be
kept well above the freezing point when the
motor is running, and it is only when the machine
has stood idle for several hours that care
must be taken to prevent the formation of ice
in the circulating system.</p>

<p>Aside from keeping the car in a warm place
whenever the motor is to be at rest more than
two hours, there is only one method of preventing
the cooling water from freezing, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
is by the introduction of some chemical that
lowers the point at which the liquid will turn
to a solid. There are several ingenious heaters
available that are attached to the circulating
pipes and that serve to keep all of the jacket
water warm; the use of these producing the
same conditions as though the car were kept
in an artificially-heated garage.</p>

<p>One of the most common liquids used in the
cooling water to prevent freezing is alcohol.
If equal parts of wood alcohol and water are
used in the cooling system, the resulting mixture
will not freeze until it reaches a temperature
colder than 25 degrees below zero. A
weaker mixture&mdash;one having 25 per cent. of
wood alcohol&mdash;will freeze at about zero, and
it therefore depends upon the prevailing cold-weather
temperature as to the proper proportion
that should be used. It must be remembered
that the boiling point of alcohol is much
lower than is that of water, and that therefore
a mixture that will not freeze in exceedingly
cold weather is liable to boil away on the first
moderate day on which the car is run. The
above-mentioned 50 per cent. mixture of wood
alcohol and water will boil at 135 degrees,
while the 25 per cent. solution will withstand a
temperature 40 degrees higher before it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
transformed into vapor. As the lower temperature
will be reached easily if the motor is
run for some time in comparatively moderate
weather, it will be seen that the stronger mixture
should be used only where winters are
very severe. It must also be borne in mind
that, as alcohol boils more readily than does
water, it follows that it will evaporate more
easily, as well. Therefore, in order to maintain
a uniform proportion of wood alcohol to
water, the former should be replenished more
often than is the latter.</p>

<p>Glycerine is another substance that is often
mixed with the cooling water to prevent the
latter from freezing. A 50 per cent. mixture
of this and water has a freezing point of about
zero, or slightly lower, and boils at practically
the same temperature as water&mdash;210 degrees.
Combinations of wood alcohol and glycerine
may be used&mdash;equal parts of each being the
usual proportion&mdash;and thus various freezing
and boiling points may be obtained.</p>

<p>The radiator is one of the most delicate
parts of the motor car's construction, and yet
it is the most exposed to flying sticks and stones
that may be thrown up by the rapid travel of
the car. The car owner may do well to follow
the practice of many racing drivers who place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
a heavy wire mesh screen in front of the radiator
as a protection against obstacles that
may be struck by the front of the car. It
would seem that sticks and stones would be
thrown toward the rear of the car, and would
therefore avoid the radiator by a wide margin,
but experience has proved that, at high speed,
such loose pieces are frequently forced forward
and are <em>run</em> into by the front of the car.</p>

<span class="smcap small">Two-Cycle Motors</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> has always been a strong prejudice
in favor of the four-cycle motor
for the power plant of the gasoline
automobile. This may be due to the fact that
designers have spent most of their time and
energy on the development of this engine, and
that therefore the two-cycle type has not yet
been sufficiently "tried out" in the motor car
to enable us to judge fairly as to its real merits.
Certain it is that in the few instances in which
the two-cycle motor has been used as an automobile
power plant, the results have been
highly satisfactory, and the present vogue of the
four-cycle motor&mdash;with well over 98 per cent.
of the automobiles now made adhering to this
type&mdash;is largely due to popular prejudice in its
favor.</p>

<p>As has been described in the <a href="#CHAPTER_I">first chapter</a>
of the present volume, the four-cycle motor
devotes a separate stroke to each of the events
of expansion, scavenging or expulsion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
burned gases, suction, and compression. The
two-cycle motor, on the other hand, devotes but
two strokes to these four events, and there is
therefore an explosion twice as often in the
two-cycle engine cylinder as is the case with
the four-cycle type. But in lieu of the suction
stroke of the four-cycle motor, there must be
some method of forcing the charge into the
cylinder of the two-cycle engine. The base, or
compartment below the piston, in which the
crank revolves, is used for this purpose. As
the piston travels upward on its compression
stroke, a partial vacuum is formed in the base,
and if a passage is opened between this compartment
and the carburetor, the charge will
be sucked in.</p>

<p>All outside connections with the base are
tightly closed on the down-stroke of the piston,
and consequently the recently-inhaled
charge will be compressed, ready for its entrance
into the cylinder above the piston as
soon as the connecting passage is opened. This
passage is opened, as has already been
described, at the bottom of the stroke and the
compressed charge rushes in and fills the space
in the cylinder that at that time is being vacated
by the exhaust gases.</p>

<p>The majority of two-cycle motors are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
without any valve mechanism, the opening and
closing of the passages being entirely automatic.
These passages are cast with the engine
and lead into the cylinder through openings in
the walls called "ports." The opening leading
from the cylinder to the exhaust pipe, or
exhaust port, is placed near the bottom of the
stroke so that it is covered by the piston, except
at the lower extremity of the travel of the
latter. Just below the exhaust port, and on
the opposite side of the interior of the cylinder,
is placed the intake port, or opening of
the passage connecting the cylinder with the
base.</p>

<p>Now, as the piston is forced downward, it
uncovers the exhaust port and an easy means
of escape is furnished for the burned gases.
Immediately after this, the intake port on the
opposite side is uncovered by the still-descending
piston, and the previously compressed
charge, which is only awaiting the opportunity
in the base, "blows" in. The exhaust gases
are still escaping when this happens, and therefore
it is necessary to prevent the incoming
charge from passing directly across the top of
the piston and out through the exhaust port
before use has been made of its explosive qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>Consequently, to keep it in its proper path,
a baffle plate is attached to the top of the piston
which serves to deflect the incoming charge
toward the top of the cylinder, and this not
only prevents the loss of the mixture, but also
furnishes a blast of air that helps to blow out
the burned gases. On the return of the piston
to the top of its stroke, it first passes over
the intake port and then covers the exhaust
port, effectually closing both and preventing
the escape of the charge during compression.
While this is going on, it must be remembered,
the piston is forming the partial vacuum in the
base, which serves to draw in the charge for
the succeeding explosion.</p>

<p>If the charge is drawn directly into the base
from the carburetor, a check valve must be
used in the pipe connecting the two; otherwise
the mixture would be forced back into the carburetor
the instant the piston began its descent.
A two-cycle motor drawing its charge
in this manner is known as the two-port type,
for there are only the exhaust and the inlet
ports in the interior of the cylinder walls. The
passage connecting the carburetor with the
base may enter at the bottom of the cylinder,
for this space and the base are the same when
the piston is at the top of its stroke. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
if this port is placed so that it is uncovered
when the piston is at the top of its stroke, it
will admit the charge to the base at a time
when a partial vacuum has been created in this
compartment by the upward movement of the
piston.</p>

<p>This port is again covered as soon as the piston
starts on its downward journey, and thus
the charge is prevented from escaping until
the intake port connecting the base with the
top of the cylinder is opened. Such a two-cycle
motor is known as the three-port type,
and it will be seen that not even an automatic
check valve is used in its passages&mdash;and it is
consequently a "valveless" motor in the
liberal interpretation of the term.</p>

<p>The high velocity of the charge recompenses
for the short time that the port is uncovered,
and consequently the base is filled with nearly
as large an amount of charge as is the case with
the two-port motor&mdash;which allows the incoming
gases to enter the crank case during the entire
upward stroke of the piston.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the piston of the
two-cycle motor acts as a pump in two ways.
First, the vacuum is formed that serves to draw
the charge into the crank case, or base, of the
motor; and second, the return stroke of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
piston compresses this recently-inhaled charge
and makes it ready to be "shot" up into the
cylinder as soon as the piston has uncovered
the port that forms the upper terminal of the
communicating passage. There can, of course,
no greater amount of fresh charge enter the
cylinder than is drawn into the crank case.
Consequently, the amount to which the cylinder
will be filled depends upon the vacuum
formed and the pressure exerted upon the
charge by the succeeding down-stroke of the piston.
It is to be supposed that the piston rings
will be tight and that none of the charge can
escape by them, and therefore the vacuum
formed and pressure exerted in the crank case
will depend entirely upon the displacement of
the piston in its travel compared with the total
capacity of the crank case. In other words, if
the crank case is large and the piston is small
and travels but a short distance, its pump action
on the entire volume will be small. But
if the crank case is small and the travel of the
piston alternately doubles and halves the
volume, the motion of the piston will cause the
pressure in the crank case to vary greatly.</p>

<p>In a preceding paragraph it has been
described in what manner the incoming charge
in the two-cycle motor was used to "scavenge"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
the cylinder, or rid it of burned gases, by deflecting
the mixture and allowing this to force
out the remaining exhaust before the exhaust
port was closed by the upward motion of the
piston. It is evident that the greater the force,
within certain limits, with which the charge
enters the cylinder, the more perfect will be the
scavenging action. But there is a limit to the
pressure that can be attained by the mixture
when it is compressed in the crank case previous
to its discharge into the cylinder. This
limit is determined by the size of the space required
for the revolution of the crank and
"big end" of the connecting rod, and by the
volume displaced by the motion of the piston.
The crank must have room in which to revolve,
and the displacement of the piston can only be
the area of its top multiplied by its length of
stroke. Thus eight pounds per square inch is
about the usual limit of crank case compression
with this type of two-cycle motor. This may
be varied slightly one way or the other by the
arrangement of the ports, but it makes slight
difference whether the motor is of the two- or
three-port type so far as this consideration is
concerned.</p>

<p>Two-cycle motors have been designed which
combine the principles of action of both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
two- and three-port types. The most important
departure from the generally-accepted type
of two-cycle motor, however, is the design in
which the charge is fed into the cylinder from
a chamber that is absolutely independent of
the crank case proper. This may be accomplished
in several ways. There may be what
is termed a "differential piston" in which a
separate plunger operates in the interior of the
hollow "trunk" piston, and by means of the
proper connection with the crank shaft compresses
the charge in the chamber thus formed
at the time it is to be forced into the cylinder.</p>

<p>Another design for obtaining intake compression
independent of the crank case consists
of a collar, or circular enlargement at the
base of the piston. This collar reciprocates
within the lower portion of the piston in a
chamber which has been bored to the exact size.
The collar consequently forms a variable base
for this compartment, and as the piston descends,
the collar travels with it, thus drawing
in a charge of the fresh mixture. On the upward
stroke, this mixture is compressed by the
collar as it reduces the size of the compartment.
It will be seen that such a motor can
be designed to compress the charge to almost
any amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>Inasmuch as the mixture, as mentioned
above, is compressed on the up-stroke of the
piston, it is evident that it cannot be discharged
into that particular cylinder at that time&mdash;for
the mixture should be delivered to its cylinder
only when the piston is at the bottom of
its stroke. In the case of a four-cylinder engine,
however, one of the pistons would be in
the proper position for the entrance of the
charge, and it is into this cylinder, that the
compressed mixture is forced. The compression
space in each cylinder, therefore, works
for its neighbor, rather than for itself.</p>

<p>This interchange of courtesies is obtained
through the good offices of a distributor in
the form of a rotating, hollow cylinder having
ports cut throughout its length that register
with corresponding passages leading to the
various cylinders. This distributor is timed
with the crank shaft of the motor, and may be
driven either by a gear or by a silent chain.
As the mixture is compressed in the separate
chamber of one cylinder, the passage leading
to the distributor is opened by the revolution
of the latter, and the charge is led through this
passage, the distributor, and thence through
another passage&mdash;also opened by the distributor&mdash;to
the proper cylinder. The cylinders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
thus operate in pairs, one receiving its charge
while the other is about to begin its explosion
stroke&mdash;and vice versa.</p>

<p>The force of the explosion in a gasoline engine
cylinder is not only dependent upon the
amount and nature of the inflammable mixture
admitted, but upon the force with which it is
compressed, as well. The average compression
pressure of a two- or four-cycle engine of
the ordinary type, is from 60 to 70 pounds per
square inch. Inasmuch as this pressure, assuming
that the rings and valves are tight, is
proportional to the displacement of the piston
stroke compared with the volume of the clearance
space, the amount of compression is constant
at all speeds and loads of the motor.
Should it be possible to increase this compression
at will, it would be found that, with a
warm motor, a pressure in the neighborhood of
100 pounds per square inch would serve to generate
sufficient heat to ignite the mixture before
the formation of the spark&mdash;for it is one of the
elementary laws of physics that a gas will become
heated when compressed. It is for this
reason that the compression pressure of the
ordinary automobile motor is kept in the
neighborhood of 70 pounds per square inch.</p>

<p>A method of varying compression pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
to meet individual load requirements has been
devised for some motors, however, and while
such types are not as yet in general use in automobiles,
it is probable that the near future
will find much advancement along these lines.
One such two-cycle motor that has been designed
especially for automobile use employs
a separate air compressor driven by the engine
itself and used as the clutch and variable
speed transmission of the car. The amount
of pressure generated in the compressor is dependent
upon the resistance offered to its operation&mdash;or,
in other words, it increases with additional
load carried by the motor. The compression,
or compressed air, rather, is carried
directly from the compressor to the cylinders
of the motor, being admitted at the proper
time by a rotary valve driven by the crank
shaft. Thus the compression in each cylinder
is automatically regulated by the load, and a
motor of this type possesses a high "overload"
capacity.</p>

<p>The motor mentioned above operates on
somewhat the same principles as those found
in the Diesel engine, which will be, as many
predict, the ultimate type of internal combustion
motor. The Diesel motor is not necessarily
a particular make of engine, but bears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the name of the originator of the principles
involved. These are distinct from those of the
Otto cycle, which is the principle upon which
practically all automobile motors operate. The
Otto cycle consists of the well-known series
of events in the cylinder, as follows: Ignition,
followed by the explosion, or expansion of the
burned charge; discharge of the exhaust gases,
or scavenging; admission of the fresh charge,
suction; and compression of the newly-received
mixture previous to ignition and the repetition
of the cycle. In speaking of the Otto and
Diesel engines, it must be borne in mind that
they are referred to as a class, rather than as
a particular make&mdash;as one would mention poppet
valve or sleeve valve engines&mdash;for there
may be many manufacturers of each type.</p>

<p>Although the Diesel principle may be applied
to either the two or four-cycle type of motor,
it is to the former design that it lends itself
unusually well. This motor operates a two-stage
air compressor in conjunction with a storage
tank. At the beginning of the compression
stroke, pure air under high pressure is admitted
to the cylinder. In its upward travel,
the piston compresses this air to a pressure approximating
500 pounds per square inch.
While it has been shown that such a pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
is about five times more than enough to generate
sufficient heat to cause premature ignition,
it must be remembered that, unlike the ordinary
type of motor, this is only pure air that
is injected into the cylinder and contains none
of the explosive gasoline vapor. At the top
of the stroke, however, when the compression
is at its maximum, the fuel is injected directly
into the cylinder without having been previously
vaporized.</p>

<p>This is another feature in which the Diesel
motor is entirely different from the Otto type,
for the latter must employ a carburetor to
vaporize the fuel before it can be admitted to
the cylinder. But inasmuch as there is already
a pressure approximating 500 pounds per
square inch in the cylinder of the Diesel motor
at the time the fuel is injected, there must be
a force behind the latter of 750 or 1,000
pounds per square inch in order to enable it to
overcome the resistance of the highly-compressed
air in the cylinder. In short, the liquid
fuel is sprayed directly into the cylinder at a
pressure of 750 or 1,000 pounds per square
inch. This tremendous pressure is sufficient,
not only to vaporize the particles of fuel as
soon as they enter the cylinder from the nozzle,
or "atomizer," but to cause them to burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
into flame, as well. In other words, the compression
of the air previously has generated
sufficient heat in the cylinder to ignite the fuel
immediately on its admission.</p>

<p>The fuel continues to be injected into the
cylinder during the greater part of the down-stroke
of the piston. In this respect, also, is
the Diesel motor radically different from the
Otto type, for the latter receives its full charge
at one time and fires the entire amount in a
single "explosion." In the Diesel motor, on
the other hand, the ignition continues as long
as fuel is admitted, and thus this engine is of
the internal <em>combustion</em> type in the strictest
sense of the word. It is, after all, the expansion
of the gases due to the heat of combustion
that produces the power in a gasoline engine,
and if the fuel can be so admitted that it can
burn during the greater part of the stroke, a
high efficiency will be obtained.</p>

<p>The exhaust gases of the ordinary two-cycle
motor pass out of the exhaust port as it is uncovered
by the descent of the piston. Those
that remain are forced out by the sudden admission
of the fresh charge, which is deflected
upward and is intended to scavenge the top of
the cylinder. But it is claimed that thus employing
the fresh mixture as a scavenging agent is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
wasteful of the fuel-permeated charge and does
not conduce to efficient running. The system
is simple in the extreme, however, and does its
work well in small installations in which fuel
economy is not of vital importance. But in
the two-cycle Diesel type of engine, the high
pressure of the pure air is used for scavenging,
and as this is admitted with so large an initial
force, the exhaust port may remain uncovered
for a longer period than would be the case were
the air to rely entirely on the up-stroke of the
piston for its compression. Then too, whatever
air may escape contains no fuel, and consequently
efficient scavenging may be obtained
without waste.</p>

<p>At the high pressure at which the fuel is injected
into the cylinder of the Diesel engine,
practically any grade of gasoline, naphtha,
kerosene, crude oil, or other form of petroleum
can be vaporized. The compressed air employed
in the compression and injection of the
fuel is also used for starting the motor, for
this is not a type that is amenable to hand cranking.
Thus the Diesel type of engine can be
run in any weather on any grade of oil fuel,
and as the carburetor and electrical ignition
system are absolutely eliminated, two of the
great sources of trouble of the automobile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
motor are absent&mdash;and this feature, alone, even
more than the superior economy of operation,
will appeal to the average motorist.</p>

<p>Just when this type of motor will be taken
up by automobile designers is difficult to state.
The Diesel type of engine has proved so wonderfully
successful for large stationary power
plants and for marine purposes, and its reliability
is so absolute on all grades of fuel, that
this motor may solve the failing-gasoline-supply
problem. As yet, about 100 horsepower is
the smallest unit that has been made in any
quantities, but it was recently announced that
this type would, in the very near future, be
built for motor trucks and other commercial
vehicles. Consequently, it is well for all those
interested in the application of the two-cycle
motor to the automobile to understand the elementary
principles on which this radically-different
type operates.</p>
